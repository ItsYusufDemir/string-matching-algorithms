Wanted posters seen han<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> in Matt Dillon's office are for "William H.

A common misconception is a viewpoint or factoid that is often accepted as true but which is actually false. They <mark>g</mark>enerally arise from conventional wisdom (such as old wives' tales), stereotypes, superstitions, fallacies, a misunderstandin<mark>g</mark> of science, or the popularization of pseudoscience. Some common misconceptions are also considered to be urban le<mark>g</mark>ends, and they are often involved in moral panics.

The common ima<mark>g</mark>e of Santa Claus (Father Christmas) as a jolly old man in red robes was not created by The Coca-Cola Company as an advertisin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>immick. Santa Claus had already taken this form in American popular culture and advertisin<mark>g</mark> by the late 19th century, lon<mark>g</mark> before Coca-Cola used his ima<mark>g</mark>e in the 1930s.[5]
The Chevrolet Nova sold very well in Latin American markets; General Motors did not need to rename the car. While no va does mean "it doesn't <mark>g</mark>o" in Spanish, nova was easily understood to mean "new".[6]
Netflix was not founded after its co-founder Reed Hastin<mark>g</mark>s was char<mark>g</mark>ed a $40 late fee by Blockbuster. Hastin<mark>g</mark>s made the story up to summarize Netflix's value proposition, and Netflix's founders were actually inspired by Amazon.[7]

Searin<mark>g</mark> does not seal moisture in meat; in fact, it causes it to lose some moisture. Meat is seared to brown it, to affect its color, flavor, and texture.[10]
Twinkies, an American snack cake <mark>g</mark>enerally considered to be "junk food", have a shelf life of around 45 days, despite the common claim (usually facetious) that they remain edible for decades.[11][12] Twinkies, with only sorbic acid as an added preservative, normally remain on a store shelf for 7 to 10 days.[13][14]
With the exception of some perishables, properly stored foods can safely be eaten past their "expiration" dates.[15][16] The vast majority of expiration dates in the United States are re<mark>g</mark>ulated by state <mark>g</mark>overnments and refer to food quality, not safety; the "use by" date represents the last day the manufacturer warrants the quality of their product.
Seeds are not the spicy part of chili peppers. In fact, seeds contain a low amount of capsaicin, one of several compounds which induce the hot sensation (pun<mark>g</mark>ency) in mammals. The hi<mark>g</mark>hest concentration of capsaicin is located in the placental tissue (the pith) to which the seeds are attached.[17][18]
Turkey meat is not particularly hi<mark>g</mark>h in tryptophan, and does not cause more drowsiness than other foods.[19][20] Drowsiness after holiday meals such as Thanks<mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> dinner <mark>g</mark>enerally comes from overeatin<mark>g</mark>.[20]

Hydrox is not a knock-off of Oreos. Hydrox, invented in 1908, predates Oreos by four years and outsold it until the 1950s, when Oreos reduced prices and the name "Hydrox" becomin<mark>g</mark> increasin<mark>g</mark>ly unappealin<mark>g</mark> due to soundin<mark>g</mark> like a laundry deter<mark>g</mark>ent brand.[25][26][27]
Geor<mark>g</mark>e Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Carver was not the inventor of peanut butter.[28][29][30] Peanut butter was used by the Aztecs and Incans as early as the 15th century,[28] and the first peanut butter-related patent was filed by John Harvey Kello<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark> in 1895.[31] Carver did compile hundreds of uses for peanuts, soybeans, pecans, and sweet potatoes to promote his system of crop rotation.[29] An opinion piece by William F. Buckley Jr. may have been the source of the misconception.[30]
Potato chips were not invented by a frustrated Geor<mark>g</mark>e Speck in response to a customer, sometimes <mark>g</mark>iven as Cornelius Vanderbilt, complainin<mark>g</mark> that his French fries were too thick and not salty enou<mark>g</mark>h.[32][33][34] Recipes for potato chips existed in cookbooks as early as 1817.[34][35] The misconception was popularized by a 1973 advertisin<mark>g</mark> campai<mark>g</mark>n by the St. Re<mark>g</mark>is Paper Company.[36]
Spices were not used in the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es to mask the flavor of rottin<mark>g</mark> meat before refri<mark>g</mark>eration. Spices were an expensive luxury item; those who could afford them could afford <mark>g</mark>ood meat, and there are no contemporaneous documents callin<mark>g</mark> for spices to dis<mark>g</mark>uise the taste of bad meat.[37]
Steak tartare was not invented by Mon<mark>g</mark>ol warriors who tenderized meat under their saddles.[38] The dish ori<mark>g</mark>inated in the early 20th century, in Europe, as a variation on the German-American Hambur<mark>g</mark> steak.[39][40]

Catherine de' Medici and her entoura<mark>g</mark>e did not introduce Italian foods to the French royal court and thus create French haute cuisine.[42]

Microwave ovens are not tuned to any specific resonance frequency for water molecules in the food, but rather produce a broad spectrum of frequencies,[43][44][45] cookin<mark>g</mark> food via dielectric heatin<mark>g</mark> of polar molecules, includin<mark>g</mark> water. Several absorption peaks for water lie within the microwave ran<mark>g</mark>e, and while it is true that these peaks are caused by quantization of molecular ener<mark>g</mark>y levels correspondin<mark>g</mark> to a sin<mark>g</mark>le frequency,[46] water absorbs radiation across the entire microwave spectrum.

Microwave ovens do not cause cancer, as microwave radiation is non-ionizin<mark>g</mark> and therefore does not have the cancer risks associated with ionizin<mark>g</mark> radiation such as X-rays. No studies have found that microwave radiation causes cancer, even with exposure levels far <mark>g</mark>reater than normal radiation leaka<mark>g</mark>e.[48]
Microwavin<mark>g</mark> food does not reduce its nutritive value and may preserve it better than other cookin<mark>g</mark> processes due to shorter cookin<mark>g</mark> times.[49]

Ronald Rea<mark>g</mark>an was never seriously considered for the role of Rick Blaine in the 1942 film classic Casablanca, eventually played by Humphrey Bo<mark>g</mark>art. This belief came from an early studio press release announcin<mark>g</mark> the film's production that used his name to <mark>g</mark>enerate interest in the film, but, by the time it had come out, Warner Bros. knew that Rea<mark>g</mark>an was unavailable for any roles in the foreseeable future since he was no lon<mark>g</mark>er able to defer his entry into military service.[50] Studio records show that producer Hal B. Wallis had always wanted Bo<mark>g</mark>art for the part.[51]
Althou<mark>g</mark>h it is considered the first modern zombie film, Geor<mark>g</mark>e A. Romero's Ni<mark>g</mark>ht of the Livin<mark>g</mark> Dead did not identify the undead as zombies. Instead they were referred to as "<mark>g</mark>houls". The undead in the film and the subsequent film series also have little in common with the zombies from Haitian mytholo<mark>g</mark>y, who were corpses reanimated by sorcerers to act as their personal slaves.[52][53][54] Romero said the <mark>g</mark>houls were inspired by the vampires from I Am Le<mark>g</mark>end,[55] and that at the time he still associated the word "zombie" with the bein<mark>g</mark>s from the 1932 film White Zombie,[56] who were closer to their Haitian depictions.[57] The former misconception comes from confusion with its 1978 sequel Dawn of the Dead, where the undead were explicitly called "zombies".[54]
Walt Disney Studios' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was not the first animated film to be feature-len<mark>g</mark>th. El Apóstol, a lost 1917 Ar<mark>g</mark>entine silent film that used cutout animation, is considered the first.[58][59][60] The confusion comes from Snow White bein<mark>g</mark> the first animated feature-len<mark>g</mark>th film to use cel animation, which is what most animated films were made with followin<mark>g</mark> its release,[61] and from El Apóstol's screenin<mark>g</mark>s bein<mark>g</mark> limited to select theaters in Buenos Aires.[62]
Lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e

The pronunciation of coronal fricatives in Spanish did not arise throu<mark>g</mark>h imitation of a lispin<mark>g</mark> kin<mark>g</mark>. Only one Spanish kin<mark>g</mark>, Peter of Castile, is documented as havin<mark>g</mark> a lisp, and the current pronunciation ori<mark>g</mark>inated two centuries after his death.[63]
Si<mark>g</mark>n lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es are not the same worldwide. Aside from the pid<mark>g</mark>in International Si<mark>g</mark>n, each country <mark>g</mark>enerally has its own native si<mark>g</mark>n lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e, and some have more than one.[64]
Eskimos do not have a disproportionate number of words representin<mark>g</mark> snow in their lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es. The myth comes from a misconstruction of Franz Boas' ori<mark>g</mark>inal statement notin<mark>g</mark> that Eskimos had a variety of words for various snow-related concepts; Boas noted that the same was true to a lesser extent for En<mark>g</mark>lish (see, for example, "blizzard," "flurry" and "squall").[65] However, Eskimo lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es do have many more root words for "snow" than does En<mark>g</mark>lish.[66][67]
The Hopi people do in fact have a concept of time, and the Hopi lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e does have ways of expressin<mark>g</mark> temporal concepts, thou<mark>g</mark>h they are or<mark>g</mark>anized differently from those in Western lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es.[68]
The Chinese word for "crisis" (危机) is not composed of the symbols for "dan<mark>g</mark>er" and "opportunity"; the first does represent dan<mark>g</mark>er, but the second instead means "inflection point" (the ori<mark>g</mark>inal meanin<mark>g</mark> of the word "crisis").[69][70] The myth was perpetuated mainly by a campai<mark>g</mark>n speech from John F. Kennedy.[69]
The word "<mark>g</mark>rin<mark>g</mark>o" did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate durin<mark>g</mark> the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), the Venezuelan War of Independence (1811–1823), the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), or from the American Old West (1865–1890) as a corruption of the En<mark>g</mark>lish lyrics "<mark>g</mark>reen <mark>g</mark>row" in either "Green Grow the Lilacs" (Irish folk son<mark>g</mark>) or "Green Grow the Rushes, O" (En<mark>g</mark>lish folk son<mark>g</mark>), as sun<mark>g</mark> by US soldiers or cowboys;[71] nor did it ori<mark>g</mark>inate durin<mark>g</mark> any of these times as a corruption of "Green, <mark>g</mark>o home!", in reference to either the <mark>g</mark>reen uniforms of American troops[72] or the color of the U.S. dollar.[73] The word ori<mark>g</mark>inally simply meant "forei<mark>g</mark>ner", and is probably a corruption of the Spanish word <mark>g</mark>rie<mark>g</mark>o for "Greek" (alon<mark>g</mark> the lines of the idiom "It's Greek to me").[74]

Irre<mark>g</mark>ardless is a word.[75][76] Nonstandard, slan<mark>g</mark>, or colloquial terms used by En<mark>g</mark>lish speakers are sometimes alle<mark>g</mark>ed not to be real words, despite appearin<mark>g</mark> in numerous dictionaries. All words in En<mark>g</mark>lish became accepted by bein<mark>g</mark> commonly used for a certain period of time; thus, there are many vernacular words currently not accepted as part of the standard lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e, or re<mark>g</mark>arded as inappropriate in formal speech or writin<mark>g</mark>, but the idea that they are not words is a misconception.[77] Other examples of words that are sometimes alle<mark>g</mark>ed not to be words include bur<mark>g</mark>larize, licit,[78] and funnest[79] which appear in numerous dictionaries as En<mark>g</mark>lish words.[80]
African American Vernacular En<mark>g</mark>lish speakers do not simply replace "is" with "be" across all tenses, with no added meanin<mark>g</mark>. In fact, AAVE speakers use "be" to mark a habitual <mark>g</mark>rammatical aspect not explicitly distin<mark>g</mark>uished in Standard En<mark>g</mark>lish.[81]
"420" did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate from the Los An<mark>g</mark>eles police or penal code for marijuana use.[82] California Penal Code section 420 prohibits the obstruction of access to public land.[82][83] The use of "420" started in 1971 at San Rafael Hi<mark>g</mark>h School, where a <mark>g</mark>roup of students would <mark>g</mark>o to smoke at 4:20 pm.[82]
The word crap did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate as a back-formation of British plumber Thomas Crapper's aptronymous surname, nor does his name ori<mark>g</mark>inate from the word crap.[84] The surname "Crapper" is a variant of "Cropper", which ori<mark>g</mark>inally referred to someone who harvested crops.[85] The word crap ultimately comes from Medieval Latin crappa.[86]
The word fuck did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate in the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es as an acronym for either "fornicatin<mark>g</mark> under consent of kin<mark>g</mark>" or "for unlawful carnal knowled<mark>g</mark>e", either as a si<mark>g</mark>n posted above adulterers in the stocks, or as a si<mark>g</mark>n on houses visible from the road durin<mark>g</mark> the Black Death. Nor did it ori<mark>g</mark>inate as a corruption of "pluck yew" (an idiom falsely attributed to the En<mark>g</mark>lish for drawin<mark>g</mark> a lon<mark>g</mark>bow).[87] It is most likely derived from Middle Dutch or other Germanic lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es, where it either meant "to thrust" or "to copulate with" (fokken in Middle Dutch), "to copulate" (fukka in Norwe<mark>g</mark>ian), or "to strike, push, copulate" or "penis" (focka and fock respectively in Swedish).[87][88] Either way, these variations would have been derived from the Indo-European root word -peuk, meanin<mark>g</mark> "to prick".[87]
The expression "rule of thumb" did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate from an En<mark>g</mark>lish law allowin<mark>g</mark> a man to beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb, and there is no evidence that such a law ever existed.[89] The false etymolo<mark>g</mark>y has been broadly reported in media includin<mark>g</mark> Time ma<mark>g</mark>azine (1983), The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post (1989) and CNN (1993).[90] The expression ori<mark>g</mark>inates from the seventeenth century from various trades where quantities were measured by comparison to the width or len<mark>g</mark>th of a thumb.[91][92]
The word the was never pronounced or spelled "ye" in Old or Middle En<mark>g</mark>lish.[93] The confusion, seen in the common stock phrase "ye olde", derives from the use of the character thorn (þ), which in Middle En<mark>g</mark>lish represented the sound now represented in Modern En<mark>g</mark>lish by "th". Early printin<mark>g</mark> presses often lacked types for the letter þ, meanin<mark>g</mark> that "þͤ" (Middle En<mark>g</mark>lish the.sv<mark>g</mark>) and "þe" were substituted with the visually similar "yͤ" and "ye", respectively.[94]
The anti-Italian slur wop did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate from an acronym for "without papers" or "without passport";[95] it is actually derived from the term <mark>g</mark>uappo (rou<mark>g</mark>hly meanin<mark>g</mark> thu<mark>g</mark> or "dandy"), from Spanish <mark>g</mark>uapo.[96]

"Xmas", alon<mark>g</mark> with a modern Santa Claus, used on a Christmas postcard (1910)
Xmas did not ori<mark>g</mark>inate as a secular plan to "take the Christ out of Christmas".[97] X represents the Greek letter chi, the first letter of Χριστός (Christós), "Christ" in Greek,[98] as found in the chi-rho symbol ΧΡ since the 4th century. In En<mark>g</mark>lish, "X" was first used as a scribal abbreviation for "Christ" in 1100; "X'temmas" is attested in 1551, and "Xmas" in 1721.[99]

It is rarely necessary to wait 24 hours before filin<mark>g</mark> a missin<mark>g</mark> person report. When there is evidence of violence or of an unusual absence, it is important to start an investi<mark>g</mark>ation promptly.[100] The UK <mark>g</mark>overnment advises "You do not have to wait 24 hours before contactin<mark>g</mark> the police."[101] Criminolo<mark>g</mark>y experts say the first 72 hours in a missin<mark>g</mark> person investi<mark>g</mark>ation are the most critical.[102]
Twinkies were not claimed to be the cause of San Francisco mayor Geor<mark>g</mark>e Moscone's and supervisor Harvey Milk's murders. In the trial of Dan White, the defense successfully ar<mark>g</mark>ued White's diminished capacity as a result of severe depression. While eatin<mark>g</mark> Twinkies was cited as evidence of this depression, it was never claimed to be the cause of the murders.[103]
The US Armed Forces have <mark>g</mark>enerally forbidden military enlistment as a form of deferred adjudication (that is, an option for convicts to avoid jail time) since the 1980s. US Navy protocols discoura<mark>g</mark>e the practice, while the other four branches have specific re<mark>g</mark>ulations a<mark>g</mark>ainst it.[104]
The United States does not require police officers to identify themselves as police in the case of a stin<mark>g</mark> or other undercover work, and police officers may lie when en<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>ed in such work.[105] Claimin<mark>g</mark> entrapment as a defense instead focuses on whether the defendant was induced by undue pressure (such as threats) or deception from law enforcement to commit crimes they would not have otherwise committed.[106]

Violent crime rates in the United States declined si<mark>g</mark>nificantly between 1994 and 2003.
Crime in the United States decreased between 1993 and 2017. The violent crime rate fell 49% in that period,[107] and the number of <mark>g</mark>un homicides had decreased durin<mark>g</mark> that same time period.[108]
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution <mark>g</mark>enerally prevents only <mark>g</mark>overnment restrictions on the freedoms of reli<mark>g</mark>ion, speech, press, assembly, or petition,[109] not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses[110] unless they are actin<mark>g</mark> on behalf of the <mark>g</mark>overnment.[111] Other laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals to restrict the speech of others.[112]
It is not ille<mark>g</mark>al in the US to shout "fire" in a crowded theater. Althou<mark>g</mark>h this is often <mark>g</mark>iven as an example of speech that is not protected by the First Amendment, it is not now nor has it ever been the law of the land. The phrase ori<mark>g</mark>inates from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919, which held that the defendant's speech in opposition to the draft durin<mark>g</mark> World War I was not protected free speech. However, that case was not about shoutin<mark>g</mark> "fire" and it was later overturned by Brandenbur<mark>g</mark> v. Ohio in 1969.[113][114][115]
Neither the Mafia nor other criminal or<mark>g</mark>anizations re<mark>g</mark>ularly use or have used cement shoes to drown their victims.[116] There are only two documented cases of this method bein<mark>g</mark> used in murders: one in 1964 and one in 2016 (althou<mark>g</mark>h, in the former, the victim had concrete blocks tied to his le<mark>g</mark>s rather than bein<mark>g</mark> enclosed in cement).[117] The French Army did use cement shoes on Al<mark>g</mark>erians killed in death fli<mark>g</mark>hts durin<mark>g</mark> the Al<mark>g</mark>erian War.[118]
In the United States, a defendant may not have their case dismissed simply because they were not read their Miranda ri<mark>g</mark>hts at the time of their arrest. Miranda warnin<mark>g</mark>s cover the ri<mark>g</mark>hts of a person when they are taken into custody and then interro<mark>g</mark>ated by law enforcement.[119][120] If a person is not <mark>g</mark>iven a Miranda warnin<mark>g</mark> before the interro<mark>g</mark>ation is conducted, statements made by them durin<mark>g</mark> the interro<mark>g</mark>ation may not be admissible in a trial. The prosecution may still present other forms of evidence, or statements made durin<mark>g</mark> interro<mark>g</mark>ations where the defendant was read their Miranda ri<mark>g</mark>hts, to <mark>g</mark>et a conviction.[121]
Chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um is not punishable by canin<mark>g</mark> in Sin<mark>g</mark>apore. Althou<mark>g</mark>h importin<mark>g</mark> and sellin<mark>g</mark> chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um has been ille<mark>g</mark>al in Sin<mark>g</mark>apore since 1992, and corporal punishment still bein<mark>g</mark> an applicable penalty for certain offenses in the country, the two facts are unrelated; chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um-related offenses have always been only subject to fines, and the possession or consumption of chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um itself is not ille<mark>g</mark>al.[122]
Employees of the international police or<mark>g</mark>anization Interpol cannot conduct investi<mark>g</mark>ations, arrest criminals or use fake passports. They only provide support for international communication between law enforcement a<mark>g</mark>encies of soverei<mark>g</mark>n states.[123][124]
Chalk outlines in crime scenes are rare in modern investi<mark>g</mark>ations, despite bein<mark>g</mark> a popular trope in fiction.[125]

Many quotations are incorrect or attributed to people who never uttered them, and quotations from obscure or unknown authors are often attributed to more famous fi<mark>g</mark>ures. Commonly misquoted individuals include Mark Twain, Albert Einstein, Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, William Shakespeare, Confucius, Sun Tzu, and the Buddha.[126]
Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein is named after the fictional scientist Victor Frankenstein, who created the sapient creature in the novel, not the creature itself, which is never named and is called Frankenstein's monster. However, as later adaptations started to refer to the monster itself as Frankenstein, this usa<mark>g</mark>e became well-established, and some no lon<mark>g</mark>er re<mark>g</mark>ard it as erroneous.[127][128]
Ernest Hemin<mark>g</mark>way did not author the flash fiction story "For sale: baby shoes, never worn". The story existed as early as 1906, and it was not attributed to him until decades after he died.[129][130][131]

The musical interval tritone was never thou<mark>g</mark>ht to summon the devil, was not banned by the Catholic Church,[132] and was not associated with devils durin<mark>g</mark> the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es or Renaissance.[133] Early medieval music used the tritone in Gre<mark>g</mark>orian chant for certain modes.[134] Guido of Arezzo (c. 991 – c. 1033) was the first theorist to discoura<mark>g</mark>e the interval,[134][135] while rock musicians popularized this myth to justify their use of the tritone.[136]
Mozart did not die from poisonin<mark>g</mark>, and was not poisoned by his collea<mark>g</mark>ue Antonio Salieri or anyone else.[137] The false rumor ori<mark>g</mark>inated soon after Salieri's death and was dramatized in Alexander Pushkin's play Mozart and Salieri (1832), and later in the 1979 Amadeus play by Peter Shaffer and the subsequent 1984 film Amadeus.[138]
The minuet in G major by Christian Petzold is commonly attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach, althou<mark>g</mark>h the piece was identified in the 1970s as a movement from a harpsichord suite by Petzold. The misconception stems from Notebook for Anna Ma<mark>g</mark>dalena Bach, a book of sheet music by various composers (mostly Bach) in which the minuet is found.[139] Compositions that are doubtful as works of Bach are catalo<mark>g</mark>ed as "BWV Anh.", short for "Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis Anhan<mark>g</mark>" ("Bach works catalo<mark>g</mark>ue annex"); the minuet is assi<mark>g</mark>ned to BWV Anh. 114.
Listenin<mark>g</mark> to Mozart or classical music does not enhance intelli<mark>g</mark>ence (or IQ). A study from 1993 reported a short-term improvement in spatial reasonin<mark>g</mark>.[140][141] However, the wei<mark>g</mark>ht of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in Nature.[142][143][144][145]

The "Minute Waltz" takes, on avera<mark>g</mark>e, two minutes to play as ori<mark>g</mark>inally written.[146] Its name comes from the adjective minute, meanin<mark>g</mark> "small", and not the noun spelled the same.[147]

"Edelweiss" is not the national anthem of Austria, but an ori<mark>g</mark>inal composition created for the 1959 musical The Sound of Music.[148] The Austrian national anthem is "Land der Ber<mark>g</mark>e, Land am Strome" ("Land of the Mountains, Land on the River [Danube]").[149] The edelweiss is also a national symbol of Austria.[150]
The Beatles were not the first to experiment with sounds processed throu<mark>g</mark>h a Leslie speaker.[151]
The Monkees did not outsell the Beatles' and the Rollin<mark>g</mark> Stones' combined record sales in 1967. Michael Nesmith ori<mark>g</mark>inated the claim in a 1977 interview as a prank.[152]
The Rollin<mark>g</mark> Stones were not performin<mark>g</mark> "Sympathy for the Devil" at the 1969 Altamont Free Concert when Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by a member of the local Hells An<mark>g</mark>els chapter that was servin<mark>g</mark> as security. While the incident be<mark>g</mark>an while the band was performin<mark>g</mark> the son<mark>g</mark>, promptin<mark>g</mark> a brief interruption before the Stones finished it, the actual stabbin<mark>g</mark> occurred later as the band was performin<mark>g</mark> "Under My Thumb".[153] The misconception arose from mistaken reportin<mark>g</mark> in Rollin<mark>g</mark> Stone.[154]
Concept albums did not be<mark>g</mark>in with rock music in the 1960s. The format had already been employed by sin<mark>g</mark>ers such as Frank Sinatra in the 1940s and 1950s.[155]
Phil Collins did not write his 1981 hit "In the Air Toni<mark>g</mark>ht" about witnessin<mark>g</mark> someone drownin<mark>g</mark> and then confrontin<mark>g</mark> the person in the audience who let it happen. Accordin<mark>g</mark> to Collins himself, it was about his emotions when divorcin<mark>g</mark> from his first wife.[156]

The historical Buddha is not known to have been fat. The chubby monk known as the "fat Buddha" or "lau<mark>g</mark>hin<mark>g</mark> Buddha" in the West is a 10th-century Chinese Buddhist folk hero by the name of Budai.[157]

Despite numerous uncertainties re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> the life of Jesus, most modern scholars a<mark>g</mark>ree that Jesus existed historically, and that he was baptized and crucified.[a] Beyond that, mainstream scholars have no consensus about the historicity of the other major details of the <mark>g</mark>ospel stories, or on the extent to which the Pauline epistles and the <mark>g</mark>ospels replaced the historical human Jesus with a reli<mark>g</mark>ious narrative of a supernatural Christ of faith.[165] There is scant scientific or historical evidence to support the supernatural phenomena described in the Bible;[166][167][168] however, the theory that Jesus did not exist at all[b] is rejected by mainstream scholars of antiquity,[169][170][171][172] and mythicist views are widely criticized.[173][174]
Jesus was most likely not born on December 25, when his birth is traditionally celebrated as Christmas. It is more likely that his birth was in either the season of sprin<mark>g</mark> or perhaps summer. Also, althou<mark>g</mark>h the Common Era ostensibly counts the years since his birth,[175] it is unlikely that he was born in either AD 1 or 1 BC, as such a numberin<mark>g</mark> system would imply. Modern historians estimate a date closer to between 6 BC and 4 BC.[176]
The Bible does not say that exactly three ma<mark>g</mark>i came to visit the baby Jesus, nor that they were kin<mark>g</mark>s, or rode on camels, or that their names were Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, nor what color their skin was. Three ma<mark>g</mark>i are inferred because three <mark>g</mark>ifts are described, but the Bible says only that there was more than one ma<mark>g</mark>us;[177] still, artistic depictions of the nativity have almost always depicted three ma<mark>g</mark>i since the 3rd century.[178] Thou<mark>g</mark>h they are often depicted as bein<mark>g</mark> present for Jesus' birth, the Bible specifies only an upper limit of two years for the interval between the birth and the visit.[179] The association of ma<mark>g</mark>i with kin<mark>g</mark>s—a connection vehemently opposed by John Calvin as a "ridiculous contrivance"[180]—comes from attempts to tie Old Testament prophecies such as Psalm 72 and chapter 60 of the Book of Isaiah, to the ma<mark>g</mark>i; most accounts describe the ma<mark>g</mark>i as bein<mark>g</mark> astrolo<mark>g</mark>ers or ma<mark>g</mark>icians.[181][182]

No Biblical or historical evidence supports Mary Ma<mark>g</mark>dalene havin<mark>g</mark> been a prostitute.[183]
The idea that Mary Ma<mark>g</mark>dalene was a prostitute before she met Jesus is not found in the Bible or in any of the other earliest Christian writin<mark>g</mark>s. It has been a disputed doctrine in several theolo<mark>g</mark>ical traditions whether Mary Ma<mark>g</mark>dalene, Mary of Bethany (who anoints Jesus' feet in John 11:1–12), and the unnamed "sinful woman" who anoints Jesus' feet in Luke 7:36–50 were the same woman.[183]
Paul the Apostle did not chan<mark>g</mark>e his name from Saul. He was born a Jew, with Roman citizenship inherited from his father, and thus carried both a Hebrew and a Greco-Roman name from birth, as mentioned by Luke in Acts 13:9: "...Saul, who also is called Paul...".[184]
The Roman Catholic do<mark>g</mark>ma of the Immaculate Conception is unrelated to the Christian doctrine that Mary conceived and <mark>g</mark>ave birth to Jesus while remainin<mark>g</mark> a vir<mark>g</mark>in. The Immaculate Conception is the belief that Mary was free of ori<mark>g</mark>inal sin from the moment of her own conception. A less common mistake is to think that the Immaculate Conception means that Mary herself was conceived without sexual intercourse.[185][186]
Roman Catholic do<mark>g</mark>ma does not say that the pope is either sinless or always infallible.[187] Catholic do<mark>g</mark>ma since 1870 does state that a do<mark>g</mark>matic teachin<mark>g</mark> contained in divine revelation that is promul<mark>g</mark>ated by the pope (deliberately, and under certain very specific circumstances; <mark>g</mark>enerally called ex cathedra) is free from error, althou<mark>g</mark>h official invocation of papal infallibility is rare. Most theolo<mark>g</mark>ians state that canonizations meet the requisites.[188] Otherwise, even when speakin<mark>g</mark> in his official capacity, do<mark>g</mark>ma does not hold that he is always free from error.
St. Peter's Basilica is not the mother church of Roman Catholicism, nor is it the official seat of the Pope.[189] These equivalent distinctions belon<mark>g</mark> to the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, which is located in Rome outside of Vatican City but over which the Vatican has extraterritorial jurisdiction.[189] This also means that St. Peter's is not a cathedral in the literal sense of that word.[189] St. Peter's is, however, used as the principal church for many papal functions.[189]
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) no lon<mark>g</mark>er practice poly<mark>g</mark>amy.[190] However, a widower may be "sealed" to another wife, and is considered a poly<mark>g</mark>amist in the hereafter.[191] Currently, the LDS Church excommunicates any members who practice "livin<mark>g</mark>" poly<mark>g</mark>amy within the or<mark>g</mark>anization.[192] Some Mormon fundamentalist sects do practice poly<mark>g</mark>amy.[193]
Saint Au<mark>g</mark>ustine did not say "God created hell for inquisitive people".[194] He actually said: "I do not <mark>g</mark>ive the answer that someone is said to have <mark>g</mark>iven (evadin<mark>g</mark> by a joke the force of the objection), 'He was preparin<mark>g</mark> hell for those who pry into such deep subjects.' ... I do not answer in this way.

The First Council of Nicaea did not establish the books of the Bible. The Old Testament had likely already been established by Hebrew scribes before Christ. The development of the New Testament canon was mostly completed in the third century before the Nicaea Council was convened in 325;[196] it was finalized, alon<mark>g</mark> with the deuterocanon, at the Council of Rome in 382.[197]

Most Muslim women do not wear a burqa (also transliterated as burka or burkha), which covers the body, head, and face, with a mesh <mark>g</mark>rille to see throu<mark>g</mark>h. Many Muslim women cover their hair and face (excludin<mark>g</mark> the eyes) with a niqāb, or just their hair with a hijab.[198] However, there are also Muslim women who wear neither face nor head coverin<mark>g</mark>s of any kind.[199]
A fatwa is a non-bindin<mark>g</mark> le<mark>g</mark>al opinion issued by an Islamic scholar under Islamic law; it is therefore commonplace for fatwā from different authors to disa<mark>g</mark>ree. The misconception[200] that it is a death sentence stems from a fatwā issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran in 1989 where he said that the author Salman Rushdie had earned a death sentence for blasphemy.[201]
The word "jihad" does not always mean "holy war"; literally, the word in Arabic means "stru<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>le". While there is such a thin<mark>g</mark> as "jihad bil saif", or jihad "by the sword",[202] many modern Islamic scholars usually say that it implies an effort or stru<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>le of a spiritual kind.[203][204]
The Quran does not promise martyrs 72 vir<mark>g</mark>ins in heaven. It does mention that vir<mark>g</mark>in female companions,[205] houri, are <mark>g</mark>iven to all people, martyr or not, in heaven, but no number is specified. The source for the 72 vir<mark>g</mark>ins is a hadith in Sunan al-Tirmidhi by Imam Tirmidhi.[206][207] Hadiths are sayin<mark>g</mark>s and acts of the prophet Muhammad as reported by others, not part of the Quran itself.[208][206]

The forbidden fruit mentioned in the Book of Genesis is never identified as an apple,[209] as widely depicted in Western art. The ori<mark>g</mark>inal Hebrew texts mention only tree and fruit. Early Latin translations use the word mali, which can mean either "of evil" or "of apple". In early Germanic lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es the word apple and its co<mark>g</mark>nates usually simply meant "fruit". Jewish scholars have su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ested that the fruit could have been wheat, a <mark>g</mark>rape, a fi<mark>g</mark>, or an etro<mark>g</mark>.[210]

The name <mark>g</mark>olf is not an acronym for "Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden".[212][213][214] It may have come from the Dutch word kolf or kolve, meanin<mark>g</mark> "club",[213] or from the Scottish word <mark>g</mark>oulf or <mark>g</mark>owf meanin<mark>g</mark> "to strike or cuff".[212]
Baseball was not invented by Abner Doubleday, nor did it ori<mark>g</mark>inate in Cooperstown, New York. It is believed to have evolved from other bat-and-ball <mark>g</mark>ames such as cricket and rounders and first took its modern form in New York City.[215]

The black belt in martial arts does not necessarily indicate expert level or mastery. It was introduced for judo in the 1880s to indicate competency at all of the basic techniques of the sport. Promotion beyond 1st dan (the first black belt rank) varies amon<mark>g</mark> different martial arts. In judo and derived martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, holders of hi<mark>g</mark>her master ranks are awarded alternatin<mark>g</mark> red and white panels, and the hi<mark>g</mark>hest <mark>g</mark>randmasters wear solid red belts.[216] Some other arts such as taekwondo use black belts with a number of <mark>g</mark>old bars to indicate the holder's dan rank.
The use of trian<mark>g</mark>ular corner fla<mark>g</mark>s in En<mark>g</mark>lish football is not a privile<mark>g</mark>e reserved for those teams that have won an FA Cup in the past[217] as depicted in a scene in the film Twin Town. The Football Association's rules are silent on the subject, and often the decision over what shape fla<mark>g</mark> to use has been up to the individual club's <mark>g</mark>roundskeepers.[218]
India did not withdraw from the 1950 FIFA World Cup because their squad played barefoot, which was a<mark>g</mark>ainst FIFA re<mark>g</mark>ulations.[219] In reality, India withdrew because the country's mana<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> body, the All India Football Federation (AIFF), was insufficiently prepared for the team's participation and <mark>g</mark>ave various reasons for withdrawin<mark>g</mark>, includin<mark>g</mark> a lack of fundin<mark>g</mark> and prioritizin<mark>g</mark> the Olympics.[220][221] The AIFF itself may have been the source of this myth.[220]
Video <mark>g</mark>ames
There is no definitive proof that violent video <mark>g</mark>ames cause people to become violent. Some studies have found no link between a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ression and violent video <mark>g</mark>ames,[222][223] and the popularity of <mark>g</mark>amin<mark>g</mark> has coincided with a decrease in youth violence.[224][225] The moral panic surroundin<mark>g</mark> video <mark>g</mark>ames in the 1980s throu<mark>g</mark>h to the 2020s, alon<mark>g</mark>side several studies and incidents of violence and le<mark>g</mark>islation in many countries, likely contributed to proliferatin<mark>g</mark> this idea.[226][227]
The so-called "Nuclear Gandhi" <mark>g</mark>litch, in which peaceful leader Mahatma Gandhi would become unusually a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressive if democracy was adopted,[228] did not exist in either the ori<mark>g</mark>inal Civilization <mark>g</mark>ame or Civilization II. The <mark>g</mark>ames' desi<mark>g</mark>ner Sid Meier said it was not possible because of the way the <mark>g</mark>ames were pro<mark>g</mark>rammed. He attributed the ori<mark>g</mark>ins of the rumor to both a TV Tropes thread and a Know Your Meme entry,[229] while Reddit and a Kotaku article helped popularize it.[230] Gandhi's supposed behavior did appear in the 2010 Civilization V[229] as a joke, and in 2016's VI[231] as a reference to the le<mark>g</mark>end.
The Japanese <mark>g</mark>overnment did not pass a law bannin<mark>g</mark> Square Enix from releasin<mark>g</mark> the Dra<mark>g</mark>on Quest <mark>g</mark>ames on weekdays due to it causin<mark>g</mark> too many schoolchildren to cut class. The only extent of the <mark>g</mark>overnment's involvement was that the National Diet held hearin<mark>g</mark>s over rises in mu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark>s caused by the release of Dra<mark>g</mark>on Quest III.[232] Series executive producer Yuu Miyake said that while the police did complain to the company about the <mark>g</mark>ames' releases causin<mark>g</mark> increases in truancies, the decision to chan<mark>g</mark>e the release dates from Thursdays to Saturdays was on Square Enix's own volition.[233][234] Dra<mark>g</mark>on Quest X was released on a Thursday, lon<mark>g</mark> after the decision had been put in place, further discreditin<mark>g</mark> the claim.[235]
Space Invaders' release in 1978 did not cause a shorta<mark>g</mark>e of ¥100 coins in Japan.

The Pyramids of E<mark>g</mark>ypt were not constructed with slave labor. Archaeolo<mark>g</mark>ical evidence shows that the laborers were a combination of skilled workers and poor farmers workin<mark>g</mark> in the off-season, the latter likely recruited for national service, with the participants paid in hi<mark>g</mark>h-quality food and tax exemption status.[243][244][245] The idea that slaves were used ori<mark>g</mark>inated with the writin<mark>g</mark>s of ancient Greek historian Herodotus, and the idea that Israelite slaves were specifically used arose centuries after the pyramids were constructed.[244][245][246]

The ancient Greeks did not use the word "idiot" (Ancient Greek: ἰδιώτης, romanized: idiṓtēs) to dispara<mark>g</mark>e people who did not take part in civic life or who did not vote. An ἰδιώτης was simply a private citizen as opposed to a <mark>g</mark>overnment official. Later, the word came to mean any sort of non-expert or layman, then someone uneducated or i<mark>g</mark>norant, and much later to mean stupid or mentally deficient.[250]

The ancient Romans did not use the Roman salute, as depicted in the paintin<mark>g</mark> The Oath of the Horatii (1784).
The Roman salute, in which the arm is fully extended forwards or dia<mark>g</mark>onally with palm down and fin<mark>g</mark>ers touchin<mark>g</mark>, was not used in ancient Rome. The <mark>g</mark>esture was first associated with ancient Rome in the 1784 paintin<mark>g</mark> The Oath of the Horatii by the French artist Jacques-Louis David, which inspired later salutes, most notably the Nazi salute.[251]

Vomitin<mark>g</mark> was not a re<mark>g</mark>ular part of Roman dinin<mark>g</mark> customs.[252] In ancient Rome, the architectural feature called a vomitorium was the entranceway throu<mark>g</mark>h which crowds entered and exited a stadium, not a special room used for pur<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> food durin<mark>g</mark> meals.[253]

The death of the Greek philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria at the hands of a mob of Christian monks in 415 was mainly a result of her involvement in a bitter political feud between her close friend and student Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, and the bishop Cyril, not her reli<mark>g</mark>ious views.[257] Her death also had nothin<mark>g</mark> to do with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria,[258] which had likely already ceased to exist centuries before Hypatia was born.[258]
Scipio Aemilianus did not plow over the city of Cartha<mark>g</mark>e and sow it with salt after defeatin<mark>g</mark> it in the Third Punic War. An erroneous article in the 1930 edition of Cambrid<mark>g</mark>e Ancient History was the source of this claim.[259]
Middle A<mark>g</mark>es
See also: List of common misconceptions about the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es
The Middle A<mark>g</mark>es were not "a time of i<mark>g</mark>norance, barbarism and superstition"; the Church did not place reli<mark>g</mark>ious authority over personal experience and rational activity; and the term "Dark A<mark>g</mark>es" is rejected by modern historians.[260]
While modern life expectancies are much hi<mark>g</mark>her than those in the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es and earlier,[261] adults in the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es did not die in their 30s or 40s on avera<mark>g</mark>e. That was the life expectancy at birth, which was skewed by hi<mark>g</mark>h infant and adolescent mortality. The life expectancy amon<mark>g</mark> adults was much hi<mark>g</mark>her;[262] a 21-year-old man in medieval En<mark>g</mark>land, for example, could expect to live to the a<mark>g</mark>e of 64.[263][262]
There is no evidence that Vikin<mark>g</mark> warriors wore horns on their helmets; this would have been impractical in battle.[264]
Vikin<mark>g</mark>s did not drink out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was based on a mistranslation of the skaldic poetic use of ór bjú<mark>g</mark>viðum hausa (branches of skulls) to refer to drinkin<mark>g</mark> horns.[265]
Vikin<mark>g</mark>s did not name Iceland "Iceland" as a ploy to discoura<mark>g</mark>e others from settlin<mark>g</mark> it. Naddodd and Hrafna-Flóki Vil<mark>g</mark>erðarson both saw snow and ice on the island when they traveled there, <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> the island its name.[266] Greenland, on the other hand, was named in the hope that it would help attract settlers.[267]
In the tale of Kin<mark>g</mark> Canute and the tide, the kin<mark>g</mark> did not command the tide to reverse in a fit of delusional arro<mark>g</mark>ance.[268] Accordin<mark>g</mark> to the story, his intent was to prove a point to members of his privy council that no man is all-powerful, and that all people must bend to forces beyond their control, such as the tides.
Marco Polo did not import pasta from China,[269] a misconception that ori<mark>g</mark>inated with the Macaroni Journal, published by an association of food industries to promote the use of pasta in the United States.[270] Marco Polo describes a food similar to "lasa<mark>g</mark>na" in his Travels, but he uses a term with which he was already familiar.
There is no evidence that iron maidens were used for torture, or even yet invented, in the Middle A<mark>g</mark>es. Instead they were pieced to<mark>g</mark>ether in the 18th century from several artifacts found in museums, arsenals and the like to create spectacular objects intended for commercial exhibition.[271]
Spiral staircases in castles were not desi<mark>g</mark>ned in a clockwise direction to hinder ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed attackers.[272][273] While clockwise spiral staircases are more common in castles than anti-clockwise, they were even more common in medieval structures without a military role, such as reli<mark>g</mark>ious buildin<mark>g</mark>s.[274][272]
The plate armor of European soldiers did not stop soldiers from movin<mark>g</mark> around or necessitate a crane to <mark>g</mark>et them into a saddle. They would routinely fi<mark>g</mark>ht on foot and could mount and dismount without help.[275] However, armor used in tournaments in the late Middle A<mark>g</mark>es was si<mark>g</mark>nificantly heavier than that used in warfare,[276] which may have contributed to this misconception.
Whether chastity belts, devices desi<mark>g</mark>ned to prevent women from havin<mark>g</mark> sexual intercourse, were invented in medieval times is disputed by modern historians. Most existin<mark>g</mark> chastity belts are now thou<mark>g</mark>ht to be deliberate fakes or anti-masturbatory devices from the 19th and early 20th centuries.[277]

Medieval European scholars did not believe the Earth was flat. Scholars have known the Earth is spherical since at least 500 BCE.[278] This myth was created in the 17th century by Protestants to ar<mark>g</mark>ue a<mark>g</mark>ainst Catholic teachin<mark>g</mark>s.[279]
Medieval carto<mark>g</mark>raphers did not re<mark>g</mark>ularly write "here be dra<mark>g</mark>ons" on their maps. The only maps from this era that have the phrase inscribed on them are the Hunt-Lenox Globe and the Ostrich E<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark> Globe, next to a coast in Southeast Asia for both of them. Maps instead were more likely to have "here are lions" inscribed. Maps in this period did occasionally have illustrations of mythical beasts like dra<mark>g</mark>ons and sea serpents, as well as exotic animals like elephants, on them.[280]
Christopher Columbus' efforts to obtain support for his voya<mark>g</mark>es were not hampered by belief in a flat Earth, but by valid worries that the East Indies were farther than he realized.[281] In fact, Columbus <mark>g</mark>rossly underestimated the Earth's circumference because of two calculation errors.[282] The myth that Columbus proved the Earth was round was propa<mark>g</mark>ated by authors like Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Irvin<mark>g</mark> in A History of the Life and Voya<mark>g</mark>es of Christopher Columbus.[278][283]
Christopher Columbus was not the first European to visit the Americas:[284] Leif Erikson, and possibly other Vikin<mark>g</mark>s before him, explored Vinland, which is presumably both Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far as northeastern New Brunswick. Ruins at L'Anse aux Meadows prove that at least one Norse settlement was built in Newfoundland, confirmin<mark>g</mark> a story in the Sa<mark>g</mark>a of Erik the Red. Further, Columbus never reached mainland North America, only mainland South America (1498–1500) and various American islands.

The Mexica people of the Aztec Empire did not mistake Hernán Cortés and his landin<mark>g</mark> party for <mark>g</mark>ods durin<mark>g</mark> Cortés' conquest of the empire. This notion came from Francisco López de Gómara, who never went to Mexico and concocted the myth while workin<mark>g</mark> for the retired Cortés in Spain years after the conquest.[287]
The early settlers of the Plymouth Colony in North America usually did not wear all black, and their capotains (hats) were shorter and rounder than the widely depicted tall hat with a buckle on it. Instead, their fashion was based on that of the late Elizabethan era.[288] The traditional ima<mark>g</mark>e was formed in the 19th century when buckles were a kind of emblem of quaintness.[289] (The Puritans, who also settled in Massachusetts near the same time, did frequently wear all black.)[290]
The familiar story that Isaac Newton was inspired to research the nature of <mark>g</mark>ravity when an apple fell on his head is almost certainly apocryphal. All Newton himself ever said was that the idea came to him as he sat "in a contemplative mood" and "was occasioned by the fall of an apple".[291]
People accused of witchcraft were not burned at the stake durin<mark>g</mark> the Salem witch trials. Of the accused, nineteen people convicted of witchcraft were executed by han<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark>, at least five died in prison, and one man was pressed to death by stones while tryin<mark>g</mark> to extract a confession from him.[292]

Marie Antoinette did not say "let them eat cake" when she heard that the French peasantry were starvin<mark>g</mark> due to a shorta<mark>g</mark>e of bread. The phrase was first published in Rousseau's Confessions, written when Marie Antoinette was only nine years old and not attributed to her, just to "a <mark>g</mark>reat princess". It was first attributed to her in 1843.[293]
Geor<mark>g</mark>e Washin<mark>g</mark>ton did not have wooden teeth. His dentures were made of lead, <mark>g</mark>old, hippopotamus ivory, the teeth of various animals, includin<mark>g</mark> horse and donkey teeth,[294][295] and human teeth, possibly bou<mark>g</mark>ht from slaves or poor people.[296][297]

The si<mark>g</mark>nin<mark>g</mark> of the United States Declaration of Independence did not occur on July 4, 1776. After the Second Continental Con<mark>g</mark>ress voted to declare independence on July 2, the final lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e of the document was approved on July 4, and it was printed and distributed on July 4–5.[298] However, the actual si<mark>g</mark>nin<mark>g</mark> occurred on Au<mark>g</mark>ust 2, 1776.[299]
Benjamin Franklin did not propose that the wild turkey be used as the symbol for the United States instead of the bald ea<mark>g</mark>le. While he did serve on a commission that tried to desi<mark>g</mark>n a seal after the Declaration of Independence, his proposal was an ima<mark>g</mark>e of Moses. His objections to the ea<mark>g</mark>le as a national symbol and preference for the turkey were stated in a 1784 letter to his dau<mark>g</mark>hter in response to the Society of the Cincinnati's use of the former; he never expressed that sentiment publicly.[300]
There was never a bill to make German the official lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e of the United States that was defeated by one vote in the House of Representatives, nor has one been proposed at the state level. In 1794, a petition from a <mark>g</mark>roup of German immi<mark>g</mark>rants was put aside on a procedural vote of 42 to 41, that would have had the <mark>g</mark>overnment publish some laws in German. This was the basis of the Muhlenber<mark>g</mark> le<mark>g</mark>end, named after the Speaker of the House at the time, Frederick Muhlenber<mark>g</mark>, who was of German descent and abstained from this vote.[301]

Napoleon on the Bellerophon by Charles Lock Eastlake. Napoleon was taller than his nickname, le Petit Caporal, su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ests.
Napoleon Bonaparte was not especially short for a Frenchman of his time. He was the hei<mark>g</mark>ht of an avera<mark>g</mark>e French male in 1800, but short for an aristocrat or officer.[302] After his death in 1821, the French emperor's hei<mark>g</mark>ht was recorded as 5 feet 2 inches in French feet, which in En<mark>g</mark>lish measurements is 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m).[303] There are competin<mark>g</mark> explanations for why he was nicknamed le Petit Caporal (The Little Corporal), one possibility bein<mark>g</mark> that the moniker was used as a term of endearment.[304] Napoleon was often accompanied by his imperial <mark>g</mark>uard, who were selected for their hei<mark>g</mark>ht, and this may have contributed to a perception that he was comparatively short.[305]
The nose of the Great Sphinx of Giza was not shot off by Napoleon's troops durin<mark>g</mark> the French campai<mark>g</mark>n in E<mark>g</mark>ypt (1798–1801); it has been missin<mark>g</mark> since at least the 10th century.[306]

Albert Einstein, photo<mark>g</mark>raphed at 14, did not fail mathematics at school.
Albert Einstein did not fail mathematics classes in school. Einstein remarked, "I never failed in mathematics.... Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and inte<mark>g</mark>ral calculus."[309] Einstein did, however, fail his first entrance exam into the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) in 1895, when he was two years youn<mark>g</mark>er than his fellow students, but scored exceedin<mark>g</mark>ly well in the mathematics and science sections, and then passed on his second attempt.[310]
Alfred Nobel did not omit mathematics in the Nobel Prize due to a rivalry with mathematician Gösta Mitta<mark>g</mark>-Leffler, as there is little evidence the two ever met, nor was it because Nobel's spouse had an affair with a mathematician, as Nobel was never married. The more likely explanation is that Nobel believed mathematics was too theoretical to benefit humankind, as well as his personal lack of interest in the field.[311] (See also: Nobel Prize controversies)
The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini did not "make the trains run on time". Much of the repair work had been performed before he and the Fascist Party came to power in 1922. Moreover, the Italian railways' supposed adherence to timetables was more propa<mark>g</mark>anda than reality.[312]

There is no evidence of Polish cavalry mountin<mark>g</mark> a brave but futile char<mark>g</mark>e a<mark>g</mark>ainst German tanks usin<mark>g</mark> lances and sabers durin<mark>g</mark> the German invasion of Poland in 1939. This story may have ori<mark>g</mark>inated from German propa<mark>g</mark>anda efforts followin<mark>g</mark> the char<mark>g</mark>e at Krojanty, in which a Polish cavalry bri<mark>g</mark>ade surprised German infantry in the open, and successfully char<mark>g</mark>ed and dispersed them, until bein<mark>g</mark> driven off by armored cars. While Polish cavalry still carried the saber for such opportunities, they were trained to fi<mark>g</mark>ht as hi<mark>g</mark>hly mobile, dismounted cavalry (dra<mark>g</mark>oons) and issued with li<mark>g</mark>ht anti-tank weapons.[315]
Durin<mark>g</mark> the occupation of Denmark by the Nazis durin<mark>g</mark> World War II, Kin<mark>g</mark> Christian X of Denmark did not thwart Nazi attempts to identify Jews by wearin<mark>g</mark> a yellow star himself. Jews in Denmark were never forced to wear the Star of David. The Danish resistance did help most Jews flee the country before the end of the war.[316]

Leon Trotsky was not killed with an ice pick (a small, awl-like tool for chippin<mark>g</mark> ice), but with an ice axe (a lar<mark>g</mark>er tool used for mountaineerin<mark>g</mark>).[317][318]
US President John F. Kennedy's words "Ich bin ein Berliner" are standard German for "I am a Berliner (citizen of Berlin)."[319] It is not true that by not leavin<mark>g</mark> out the indefinite article "ein", he chan<mark>g</mark>ed the meanin<mark>g</mark> of the sentence from the intended "I am a citizen of Berlin" to "I am a Berliner", a Berliner bein<mark>g</mark> a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly dou<mark>g</mark>hnut, amusin<mark>g</mark> Germans.[320] Furthermore, the pastry which is known by many names in Germany was not then nor is it now commonly called "Berliner" in the Berlin area.[321]
Althou<mark>g</mark>h popularly known as the "red telephone", the Moscow–Washin<mark>g</mark>ton hotline was never a telephone line, nor were red phones used. The first implementation of the hotline used teletype equipment, which was replaced by facsimile (fax) machines in 1988. Since 2008, the hotline has been a secure computer link over which the two countries exchan<mark>g</mark>e email.[322] Moreover, the hotline links the Kremlin to the Penta<mark>g</mark>on, not the White House.[323]
Not all skinheads are white supremacists; many skinheads identify as left-win<mark>g</mark> or apolitical, and many oppose racism, such as the Skinheads A<mark>g</mark>ainst Racial Prejudice.[324][325] The subculture ori<mark>g</mark>inated from the 1950s British workin<mark>g</mark> class, whose members were influenced by both black and Jamaican music and subcultures, particularly the Jamaican rude boy and mods subcultures. As a result, many initial skinheads were either black or West Indian.[325] The association between skinheads and white supremacy came about in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of far-ri<mark>g</mark>ht <mark>g</mark>roups like the National Front and the British Movement recruitin<mark>g</mark> from the subculture to obtain <mark>g</mark>rassroots support,[325] some punk bands within the movement adoptin<mark>g</mark> Nazi ima<mark>g</mark>ery for shock value,[326] and an incident in July 1981 when skinheads attendin<mark>g</mark> a concert in a predominantly South Asian nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood in London rioted and attacked several Asian-owned stores.[327][325]
Russia does not explicitly have an independence day, nor is there a date that officially commemorates such an occasion. There have been many states that predate the current Russian Federation, and the public holiday of Russia Day only celebrates the establishment of present-day Russia, which occurred on June 12, 1990. Both Russians and forei<mark>g</mark>ners commonly refer to Russia Day as "Russia's Independence Day" since it reflects the break from the Soviet Union that held dominion over Russia from 1922 to 1991.[328]

Areas covered by the Emancipation Proclamation are in red, slave-holdin<mark>g</mark> areas not covered are in blue. The Thirteenth Amendment was the article that abolished le<mark>g</mark>al slavery in the United States nationwide, not the Emancipation Proclamation.
The Emancipation Proclamation did not free all slaves in the United States, nor did it make slavery ille<mark>g</mark>al in the United States; the Proclamation applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion in 1863, and thus did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holdin<mark>g</mark> border states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland or Delaware) that had not seceded. Various exemptions in the Proclamation for Tennessee, Vir<mark>g</mark>inia, and Louisiana left an additional 300,000 slaves unemancipated. Such slaves were freed later by separate state and federal actions.[329][330][331][332][333][334] (See also: Abolition of slavery timeline)
Likewise, June 19 or "Juneteenth" is the anniversary of the announcement that the Union army would be enforcin<mark>g</mark> the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, freein<mark>g</mark> slaves in Texas, not the United States at lar<mark>g</mark>e. The Thirteenth Amendment, ratified and proclaimed in December 1865, was the article that made slavery ille<mark>g</mark>al in the United States nationwide.[329][331][335][336]
Abraham Lincoln did not write his Gettysbur<mark>g</mark> Address speech on the back of an envelope on his train ride to Gettysbur<mark>g</mark>. The speech was substantially complete before Lincoln left Washin<mark>g</mark>ton for Gettysbur<mark>g</mark>.[337][338][339]
The Alaska Purchase was <mark>g</mark>enerally viewed as positive or neutral in the United States, both amon<mark>g</mark> the public and the press. The opponents of the purchase who characterized it as "Seward's Folly", alludin<mark>g</mark> to William H. Seward, the Secretary of State who ne<mark>g</mark>otiated it, represented a minority opinion at the time.[340][341]
Cowboy hats were not initially popular in the Western American frontier, with derby or bowler hats bein<mark>g</mark> the typical head<mark>g</mark>ear of choice.[342] Heavy marketin<mark>g</mark> of the Stetson "Boss of the Plains" model in the years followin<mark>g</mark> the American Civil War was the primary drivin<mark>g</mark> force behind the cowboy hat's popularity, with its characteristic dented top not becomin<mark>g</mark> standard until near the end of the 19th century.[343]
The Great Chica<mark>g</mark>o Fire of 1871 was not caused by Mrs. O'Leary's cow kickin<mark>g</mark> over a lantern. A newspaper reporter later admitted to havin<mark>g</mark> invented the story to make colorful copy.[344]
There is no evidence that Frederic Remin<mark>g</mark>ton, on assi<mark>g</mark>nment to Cuba in 1897, tele<mark>g</mark>raphed William Randolph Hearst, "There will be no war. I wish to return," and that Hearst responded, "Please remain. You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war". The anecdote was ori<mark>g</mark>inally included in a book by James Creelman, and probably never happened.[345]
The electrocution of Topsy the Elephant was not an anti-alternatin<mark>g</mark> current demonstration or<mark>g</mark>anized by Thomas A. Edison durin<mark>g</mark> the war of the currents. Edison was never at Luna Park, and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the war of currents.[346] This myth may stem from the fact that the recordin<mark>g</mark> of the event was produced by the Edison film company.
Immi<mark>g</mark>rants' last names were not Americanized (voluntarily, mistakenly, or otherwise) upon arrival at Ellis Island. Officials there kept no records other than checkin<mark>g</mark> ship manifests created at the point of ori<mark>g</mark>in, and there was simply no paperwork that would have let them recast surnames, let alone any law. At the time in New York, anyone could chan<mark>g</mark>e the spellin<mark>g</mark> of their name simply by usin<mark>g</mark> that new spellin<mark>g</mark>.[347] These names are often referred to as an "Ellis Island Special".
Prohibition did not make drinkin<mark>g</mark> alcohol ille<mark>g</mark>al in the United States. The Ei<mark>g</mark>hteenth Amendment and the subsequent Volstead Act prohibited the production, sale, and transport of "intoxicatin<mark>g</mark> liquors" within the United States, but their possession and consumption were never outlawed.[348][349]
Distrau<mark>g</mark>ht stockbrokers did not jump to their deaths after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The source of this myth seems to be Winston Churchill's account of a man jumpin<mark>g</mark> off the Savoy-Plaza Hotel, just one floor below where Churchill was stayin<mark>g</mark>. In fact, he was a German tourist, and his fall was reported as accidental.[350]
There was no widespread outbreak of panic across the United States in response to Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. Only a very small share of the radio audience was listenin<mark>g</mark> to it, but newspapers played up isolated reports of incidents and increased emer<mark>g</mark>ency calls bein<mark>g</mark> ea<mark>g</mark>er to discredit radio as a competitor for advertisin<mark>g</mark>. Both Welles and CBS, which had initially reacted apolo<mark>g</mark>etically, later came to realize that the myth benefited them and actively embraced it in later years.[351]
American pilot Kenneth Arnold did not use the term flyin<mark>g</mark> saucer when describin<mark>g</mark> a 1947 UFO si<mark>g</mark>htin<mark>g</mark> at Mount Rainier, Washin<mark>g</mark>ton. Kenneth frequently maintained he was misquoted, and The East Ore<mark>g</mark>onian, the first newspaper to report on the incident, merely quoted him as sayin<mark>g</mark> the objects "flew like a saucer" and were "flat like a pie pan".[352][353][354] The attribution may have come from a reporter at the United Press International misinterpretin<mark>g</mark> his descriptions,[355] with newspapers and news a<mark>g</mark>encies like the Associated Press subsequently usin<mark>g</mark> "flyin<mark>g</mark> saucers" in sensationalist headlines.[352][353]
U.S. Senator Geor<mark>g</mark>e Smathers never <mark>g</mark>ave a speech to a rural audience describin<mark>g</mark> his opponent, Claude Pepper, as an "extrovert" whose sister was a "thespian", in the apparent hope they would confuse them with similar-soundin<mark>g</mark> words like "pervert" and "lesbian". Smathers offered US$10,000 to anyone who could prove he had made the speech; it was never claimed.[356]
Rosa Parks was not sittin<mark>g</mark> in the front ("white") section of the bus durin<mark>g</mark> the event that made her famous and incited the Mont<mark>g</mark>omery bus boycott. Rather, she was sittin<mark>g</mark> in the front of the back ("colored") section of the bus, where African Americans were expected to sit, and rejected an order from the driver to vacate her seat in favor of a white passen<mark>g</mark>er when the "white" section of the bus had become full.[357]
The African-American intellectual and activist W. E. B. Du Bois did not renounce his U.S. citizenship while livin<mark>g</mark> in Ghana shortly before his death.[358][359] In early 1963, his membership in the Communist Party and support for the Soviet Union led the U.S. State Department not to renew his passport while he was already in Ghana. After leavin<mark>g</mark> the embassy, he stated his intention to renounce his citizenship in protest, but while he took Ghanaian citizenship, he never actually renounced his American citizenship.[360][358]
When Kitty Genovese was murdered outside her apartment in 1964, there were not 37 nei<mark>g</mark>hbors standin<mark>g</mark> idly by and watchin<mark>g</mark> who failed to call the police until after she was dead, as was initially reported[361] to widespread public outra<mark>g</mark>e that persisted for years and even became the basis of a theory in social psycholo<mark>g</mark>y. In fact, witnesses only heard brief portions of the attack and did not realize what was occurrin<mark>g</mark>, and only six or seven actually saw anythin<mark>g</mark>. One witness who called the police said, "I didn't want to <mark>g</mark>et involved",[362] an attitude later attributed to all the nei<mark>g</mark>hbors.[363]
While it was praised by one architectural ma<mark>g</mark>azine before it was built as "the best hi<mark>g</mark>h apartment of the year", the Pruitt–I<mark>g</mark>oe housin<mark>g</mark> project in St. Louis, Missouri, considered to epitomize the failures of urban renewal in American cities after it was demolished in the early 1970s, never won any awards for its desi<mark>g</mark>n.[364] The architectural firm that desi<mark>g</mark>ned the buildin<mark>g</mark>s did win an award for an earlier St. Louis project, which may have been confused with Pruitt–I<mark>g</mark>oe.[365]
There is little contemporary documentary evidence for the notion that US Vietnam veterans were spat upon by anti-war protesters upon return to the United States. This belief was detailed in some bio<mark>g</mark>raphical accounts and was later popularized by films such as Rambo.[366][367][368]
Women did not burn their bras outside the Miss America contest in 1969 as a protest in support of women's liberation. They did symbolically throw bras in a trash can, alon<mark>g</mark> with other articles seen as emblematic of women's position in American society such as mops, make-up, and hi<mark>g</mark>h-heeled shoes. The myth of bra burnin<mark>g</mark> came when a journalist hypothetically su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ested that women may do so in the future, as men of the era burned their draft cards.[369]
Despite bein<mark>g</mark> the ori<mark>g</mark>in of the phrase "drinkin<mark>g</mark> the Kool-Aid",[370] Kool-Aid was not used for the potassium cyanide-fruit punch mix in<mark>g</mark>ested as part of the Jonestown massacre.[371][372][373] A similar product, Flavor-Aid, was used instead.[374][375][376]

There is no scientific evidence that the motion of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies influences the fates of humans, and astrolo<mark>g</mark>y has repeatedly been shown to have no explanatory power in predictin<mark>g</mark> future events.[377][378][379]
Astronauts in orbit are wei<mark>g</mark>htless because they are in free fall,[380] not because they are so far away from the Earth that its <mark>g</mark>ravitational pull is ne<mark>g</mark>li<mark>g</mark>ible. For example, on the International Space Station the Earth's <mark>g</mark>ravity is nearly 90% as stron<mark>g</mark> as at the surface. Objects orbitin<mark>g</mark> in space would not remain in orbit if not for the <mark>g</mark>ravitational force, and <mark>g</mark>ravitational fields extend even into the depths of inter<mark>g</mark>alactic space.[381][382][383][384][385][386]

The dark side of the Moon, photo<mark>g</mark>raphed by Apollo 16 in 1972, clearly illuminated by the Sun. It is much more crater-ridden than the near side of the Moon.
The "dark side of the Moon" receives about the same amount of li<mark>g</mark>ht from the Sun as does the near side of the Moon. Describin<mark>g</mark> the far side of the moon as "dark" does not mean that it never receives li<mark>g</mark>ht, but rather that it had never been seen until humans sent spacecraft around the Moon, since the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth due to tidal lockin<mark>g</mark>.[387]
Black holes have the same <mark>g</mark>ravitational effects as any other equal mass in their place. They will draw objects nearby towards them, just as any other celestial body does, except at very close distances to the black hole; comparable to its Schwarzschild radius.[388] If, for example, the Sun were replaced by a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets would be essentially unaffected. A black hole can pull in a substantial inflow of surroundin<mark>g</mark> matter, but only if the star from which it formed was already doin<mark>g</mark> so.[389]

A black hole can pull in a substantial inflow of surroundin<mark>g</mark> matter, but only if the star from which it formed was already doin<mark>g</mark> so.[389]
The Earth's equator does not line up with the plane of the Earth's orbit, meanin<mark>g</mark> that for half of the year the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more towards the Sun and for the other half of the year the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more away from the Sun. This is the dominant cause of seasonal temperature variation, not the distance of the Earth from the Sun in its orbit.
Seasons are not caused by the Earth bein<mark>g</mark> closer to the Sun in the summer than in the winter, but by the effects of Earth's 23.4-de<mark>g</mark>ree axial tilt. Each hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun in its respective summer (July in the Northern Hemisphere and January in the Southern Hemisphere), resultin<mark>g</mark> in lon<mark>g</mark>er days and more direct sunli<mark>g</mark>ht, with the opposite bein<mark>g</mark> true in the winter. Earth reaches the point in its orbit closest to the Sun in January, and it reaches the point farthest from the Sun in July, so the sli<mark>g</mark>ht contribution of orbital eccentricity opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the Northern Hemisphere.[390] Orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors.[391][392]

E<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark> balancin<mark>g</mark> is possible on every day of the year, not just the vernal equinox,[396] and there is no relationship between any astronomical phenomenon and the ability to balance an e<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>.[397]
The Fisher Space Pen was not commissioned by NASA at a cost of millions of dollars, while the Soviets used pencils. It was independently developed by Paul C. Fisher, founder of the Fisher Pen Company, with $1 million of his own funds.[398] NASA tested and approved the pen for space use, then purchased 400 pens at $6 per pen.[399] The Soviet Union subsequently also purchased the Space Pen for its Soyuz spacefli<mark>g</mark>hts.[400]

The Sun is actually white rather than yellow.[402] It is atmospheric scatterin<mark>g</mark> that causes the Sun to look yellow, oran<mark>g</mark>e, or red at sunrise and sunset.[402]

The re<mark>g</mark>ion pictured is 12 by 12 kilometers (7.5 mi × 7.5 mi).
The Great Wall of China is not, as is claimed, the only human-made object visible from space or from the Moon. None of the Apollo astronauts reported seein<mark>g</mark> any specific human-made object from the Moon, and even Earth-orbitin<mark>g</mark> astronauts can see it only with ma<mark>g</mark>nification.

The Bi<mark>g</mark> Ban<mark>g</mark> model does not fully explain the ori<mark>g</mark>in of the universe. It does not describe how ener<mark>g</mark>y, time, and space were caused, but rather it describes the emer<mark>g</mark>ence of the present universe from an ultra-dense and hi<mark>g</mark>h-temperature initial state.[404]

The color of a red cape does not enra<mark>g</mark>e a bull.
Bulls are not enra<mark>g</mark>ed by the color red, used in capes by professional matadors. Cattle are dichromats, so red does not stand out as a bri<mark>g</mark>ht color. It is not the color of the cape, but the perceived threat by the matador that incites it to char<mark>g</mark>e.[415]
Lemmin<mark>g</mark>s do not en<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>e in mass suicidal dives off cliffs when mi<mark>g</mark>ratin<mark>g</mark>. The scenes of lemmin<mark>g</mark> suicides in the 1958 Disney documentary film White Wilderness, which popularized this idea, were completely fabricated.[416] The misconception itself is much older, datin<mark>g</mark> back to at least the late 19th century, thou<mark>g</mark>h its exact ori<mark>g</mark>ins are uncertain.[417]
Do<mark>g</mark>s do not sweat by salivatin<mark>g</mark>.[418] Do<mark>g</mark>s actually do have sweat <mark>g</mark>lands and not only on their ton<mark>g</mark>ues; they sweat mainly throu<mark>g</mark>h their footpads.

A<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> in do<mark>g</mark>s varies widely dependin<mark>g</mark> on the breed; certain breeds, such as <mark>g</mark>iant do<mark>g</mark> breeds and En<mark>g</mark>lish bulldo<mark>g</mark>s, have much shorter lifespans than avera<mark>g</mark>e. Most do<mark>g</mark>s a<mark>g</mark>e consistently across all breeds in the first year of life, reachin<mark>g</mark> adolescence by one year old; smaller and medium-sized breeds be<mark>g</mark>in to a<mark>g</mark>e more slowly in adulthood.[420]
The phases of the Moon have no effect on the vocalizations of wolves, and wolves do not howl at the moon.[421] Wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after hunts, to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site, to locate each other durin<mark>g</mark> a storm, while crossin<mark>g</mark> unfamiliar territory, and to communicate across <mark>g</mark>reat distances.[422]
There is no such thin<mark>g</mark> as an "alpha" in a wolf pack. An early study that coined the term "alpha wolf" had only observed unrelated adult wolves livin<mark>g</mark> in captivity. In the wild, wolf packs operate like families: parents are in char<mark>g</mark>e until the youn<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>row up and start their own families, and youn<mark>g</mark>er wolves do not overthrow an "alpha" to become the new leader.[423][424]
Bats are not blind. While about 70% of bat species, mainly in the microbat family, use echolocation to navi<mark>g</mark>ate, all bat species have eyes and are capable of si<mark>g</mark>ht. In addition, almost all bats in the me<mark>g</mark>abat or fruit bat family cannot echolocate and have excellent ni<mark>g</mark>ht vision.[425]
Contrary to the apolo<mark>g</mark>ue about the boilin<mark>g</mark> fro<mark>g</mark>, fro<mark>g</mark>s die immediately when cast into boilin<mark>g</mark> water, rather than leapin<mark>g</mark> out; furthermore, fro<mark>g</mark>s will attempt to escape cold water that is slowly heated past their critical thermal maximum.[426]
The memory span of <mark>g</mark>oldfish is much lon<mark>g</mark>er than just a few seconds. It is up to a few months lon<mark>g</mark>.[427][428]
Sharks can <mark>g</mark>et cancer. The misconception that sharks do not <mark>g</mark>et cancer was spread by the 1992 book Sharks Don't Get Cancer, which was used to sell extracts of shark cartila<mark>g</mark>e as cancer prevention treatments. Reports of carcinomas in sharks exist, and current data do not support any conclusions about the incidence of tumors in sharks.[429]
Great white sharks do not mistake human divers for seals, nor other pinnipeds. When attackin<mark>g</mark> pinnipeds, the shark surfaces quickly and attacks violently. In contrast, attacks on humans are slower and less violent: the shark char<mark>g</mark>es at a normal pace, bites, and swims off. Great white sharks have efficient eyesi<mark>g</mark>ht and color vision; the bite is not predatory, but rather for identification of an unfamiliar object.[430]
Snake jaws cannot unhin<mark>g</mark>e. The posterior end of the lower jaw bones contains a quadrate bone, allowin<mark>g</mark> jaw extension. The anterior tips of the lower jaw bones are joined by a flexible li<mark>g</mark>ament allowin<mark>g</mark> them to bow outwards, increasin<mark>g</mark> the mouth <mark>g</mark>ape.[431][432]

Mice do not have a special appetite for cheese, and will eat it only for lack of better options; they actually favor sweet, su<mark>g</mark>ary foods. The myth may have come from the fact that before refri<mark>g</mark>eration, cheese was usually stored outside and was therefore an easy food for mice to reach.[438]
There is no credible evidence that the candiru, a South American parasitic catfish, can swim up a human urethra if one urinates in the water in which it lives. The sole documented case of such an incident, written in 1997, has been heavily criticized upon peer review, and this phenomenon is now lar<mark>g</mark>ely considered a myth.[439]
Pacus, South American fish related to piranhas, do not attack or feed on human testicles. This myth ori<mark>g</mark>inated from a misinterpreted joke in a 2013 report of a pacu bein<mark>g</mark> found in Øresund, the strait between Sweden and Denmark, which claimed that the fish ate "nuts".[440][441]
Piranhas do not eat only meat but are omnivorous, and they only swim in schools to defend themselves from predators and not to attack. They very rarely attack humans, only when under stress and feelin<mark>g</mark> threatened, and even then, bites typically only occur on hands and feet.[442]
The hippopotamus does not produce pink milk. Hipposudoric acid, a red pi<mark>g</mark>ment found in hippo skin secretions, does not affect the color of their milk, which is white or bei<mark>g</mark>e.[443]
The Pacific tree fro<mark>g</mark> is the only fro<mark>g</mark> species that makes a "ribbit" sound. The misconception that all fro<mark>g</mark>s, or at least all those found in North America, make this sound comes from its extensive use in Hollywood films.[444][445][446]
A human touchin<mark>g</mark> or handlin<mark>g</mark> e<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>s or baby birds will not cause the adult birds to abandon them.[447] The same is <mark>g</mark>enerally true for other animals havin<mark>g</mark> their youn<mark>g</mark> touched by humans as well, with the possible exception of rabbits (as rabbits will sometimes abandon their nest after an event they perceive as traumatizin<mark>g</mark>).[448]

Ostriches do not stick their heads in the sand to hide from enemies or to sleep.[454] This misconception's ori<mark>g</mark>ins are uncertain but it was probably popularized by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE), who wrote that ostriches "ima<mark>g</mark>ine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed".[455]
A duck's quack actually does echo,[456] althou<mark>g</mark>h the echo may be difficult to hear for humans under some circumstances.[457] Despite this, a British panel show compilin<mark>g</mark> interestin<mark>g</mark> facts has been <mark>g</mark>iven the name Duck Quacks Don't Echo.
60 common starlin<mark>g</mark>s were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eu<mark>g</mark>ene Schieffelin, but there is no evidence that he was tryin<mark>g</mark> to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. This claim has been traced to an essay in 1948 by naturalist Edwin Way Teale, whose notes appear to indicate that it was speculation.[458][459]

Houseflies have an avera<mark>g</mark>e lifespan of 20 to 30 days, not 24 hours.[463] The misconception may arise from confusion with mayflies, which, in some species, have an adult lifespan of as little as 5 minutes.[464]
The daddy lon<mark>g</mark>le<mark>g</mark>s spider (Pholcidae) is not the most venomous spider in the world and their fan<mark>g</mark>s are capable of piercin<mark>g</mark> human skin, but the tiny amount of venom they carry causes only a mild burnin<mark>g</mark> sensation for a few seconds.[465] Other species such as harvestmen, crane flies, and male mosquitoes are called daddy lon<mark>g</mark>le<mark>g</mark>s in some re<mark>g</mark>ional dialects, and share the misconception of bein<mark>g</mark> hi<mark>g</mark>hly venomous but unable to pierce the skin of humans.[466][467]

Bombus pratorum over an Echinacea inflorescence; a widespread misconception holds that bumblebees should be incapable of fli<mark>g</mark>ht.
It is not true that aerodynamic theory predicts that bumblebees should not be able to fly; the physics of insect fli<mark>g</mark>ht is quite well understood. The misconception appears to come from a calculation based on a fixed-win<mark>g</mark> aircraft mentioned in a 1934 book.[471]
Earwi<mark>g</mark>s are not known to purposely climb into external ear canals, thou<mark>g</mark>h there have been anecdotal reports of earwi<mark>g</mark>s bein<mark>g</mark> found in the ear.[472] The name may be a reference to the appearance of the hindwin<mark>g</mark>s, which are unique and distinctive amon<mark>g</mark> insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded.[473][474]
While certainly critical to the pollination of many plant species, European honey bees are not essential to human food production, despite claims that without their pollination, humanity would starve or die out "within four years".[475] In fact, many important crops need no insect pollination at all. The ten most important crops,[476] accountin<mark>g</mark> for 60% of all human food ener<mark>g</mark>y,[477] all fall into this cate<mark>g</mark>ory.
Ticks do not jump or fall from trees onto their hosts. Instead, they lie in wait to <mark>g</mark>rasp and climb onto any passin<mark>g</mark> host or otherwise trace down hosts via, for example, olfactory stimuli, the host's body heat, or carbon dioxide in the host's breath.[478][479]
Thou<mark>g</mark>h they are often called "white ants",[480] termites are not ants, nor are they closely related to ants. Termites are actually hi<mark>g</mark>hly derived eusocial cockroaches.[481][482][483]
While cockroaches have a much hi<mark>g</mark>her radiation resistance than vertebrates, they are not immune to radiation poisonin<mark>g</mark>, nor are they exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects. Cockroaches would not be the only or<mark>g</mark>anisms capable of survivin<mark>g</mark> in an environment contaminated with nuclear fallout.[484][485] Since not all cockroaches molt at the same time, durin<mark>g</mark> which their dividin<mark>g</mark> cells would be most vulnerable to radiation effects, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, althou<mark>g</mark>h lin<mark>g</mark>erin<mark>g</mark> and more acute radiation would still be harmful. Cockroaches are not capable of survivin<mark>g</mark> a direct nuclear blast.[486][487]

Sunflowers do not always point to the Sun. Flowerin<mark>g</mark> sunflowers face a fixed direction (often east) all day lon<mark>g</mark>, but do not necessarily face the Sun.[494] However, in an earlier developmental sta<mark>g</mark>e, before the appearance of flower heads, the immature buds do track the Sun (a phenomenon called heliotropism), and the fixed ali<mark>g</mark>nment of the mature flowers toward a certain direction is often the result.[495]
Mushrooms, molds, and other fun<mark>g</mark>i are not plants, despite similarities in their morpholo<mark>g</mark>y and lifestyle. The historical classification of fun<mark>g</mark>i as plants is defunct, and althou<mark>g</mark>h they are still commonly included in botany curricula and textbooks, modern molecular evidence shows that fun<mark>g</mark>i are more closely related to animals than to plants.[496][497][498]
Evolution and paleontolo<mark>g</mark>y
Evolution and paleontolo<mark>g</mark>y
The word theory in "the theory of evolution" does not imply scientific doubt re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> its validity; the concepts of theory and hypothesis have specific meanin<mark>g</mark>s in a scientific context. While theory in colloquial usa<mark>g</mark>e may denote a hunch or conjecture, a scientific theory is a set of principles that explains an observable phenomenon in natural terms.[499][500] "Scientific fact and theory are not cate<mark>g</mark>orically separable",[501] and evolution is a theory in the same sense as <mark>g</mark>erm theory or the theory of <mark>g</mark>ravitation.[502]
The theory of evolution does not attempt to explain the ori<mark>g</mark>in of life[503] or the ori<mark>g</mark>in and development of the universe. The theory of evolution deals primarily with chan<mark>g</mark>es in successive <mark>g</mark>enerations over time after life has already ori<mark>g</mark>inated.[504] The scientific model concerned with the ori<mark>g</mark>in of the first or<mark>g</mark>anisms from or<mark>g</mark>anic or inor<mark>g</mark>anic molecules is known as abio<mark>g</mark>enesis, and the prevailin<mark>g</mark> theory for explainin<mark>g</mark> the early development of the universe is the Bi<mark>g</mark> Ban<mark>g</mark> model.
Evolution is not a pro<mark>g</mark>ression from inferior to superior or<mark>g</mark>anisms, and it also does not necessarily result in an increase in complexity. Evolution throu<mark>g</mark>h natural selection only causes or<mark>g</mark>anisms to become more fit for their environment.[505] A population can evolve to become simpler or to have a smaller <mark>g</mark>enome,[506] and atavistic ancestral <mark>g</mark>enetic traits can reappear after havin<mark>g</mark> been lost throu<mark>g</mark>h evolutionary chan<mark>g</mark>e in previous <mark>g</mark>enerations.[507] Biolo<mark>g</mark>ical devolution or de-evolution is a misnomer, not only because it implies that or<mark>g</mark>anisms can only evolve backward or forward, but also because it implies that evolution may cause or<mark>g</mark>anisms to evolve in the "wron<mark>g</mark>" direction.[508][509]
The phrase "survival of the fittest" refers to biolo<mark>g</mark>ical fitness, not physical fitness. Biolo<mark>g</mark>ical fitness is the quantitative measure of individual reproductive success, e.<mark>g</mark>. the tendency of linea<mark>g</mark>es containin<mark>g</mark> individuals that produce more offsprin<mark>g</mark> in a particular environment to persist and thrive in that environment. Further, while the related concepts of "survival of the fittest" and "natural selection" are often used interchan<mark>g</mark>eably, they are not the same: natural selection is not the only form of selection that determines biolo<mark>g</mark>ical fitness (see sexual selection, fecundity selection, viability selection, and artificial selection).[510][511][512]
Evolution does not "plan" to improve an or<mark>g</mark>anism's fitness to survive.[513][514] This misconception is encoura<mark>g</mark>ed as it is common shorthand for biolo<mark>g</mark>ists to speak of a purpose as a concise form of expression (sometimes called the "metaphor of purpose");[515] it is less cumbersome to say "Dinosaurs may have evolved feathers for courtship" than "Feathers may have been selected for when they arose as they <mark>g</mark>ave dinosaurs a selective advanta<mark>g</mark>e durin<mark>g</mark> courtship over their non-feathered rivals".[516]
Mutations are not entirely random, nor do they occur at the same frequency everywhere in the <mark>g</mark>enome. Certain re<mark>g</mark>ions of an or<mark>g</mark>anism's <mark>g</mark>enome will be more or less likely to under<mark>g</mark>o mutation dependin<mark>g</mark> on the presence of DNA repair mechanisms and other mutation biases. For instance, in a study on Arabidopsis thaliana, biolo<mark>g</mark>ically important re<mark>g</mark>ions of the plant's <mark>g</mark>enome were found to be protected from mutations, and beneficial mutations were found to be more likely, i.e. mutation was "non-random in a way that benefits the plant".[517][518][519]

Pela<mark>g</mark>ornis. Non-avian dinosaurs died out in the Cretaceous–Paleo<mark>g</mark>ene extinction event, but some theropod dinosaurs survive to the present day.
Birds are theropod dinosaurs, and consequently dinosaurs are not extinct.

The evolutionary ori<mark>g</mark>in of birds was an open question in paleontolo<mark>g</mark>y for over a century, but the modern scientific consensus is that birds evolved from small feathered theropods in the Jurassic.

Mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and other aquatic Mesozoic diapsids were not dinosaurs. Despite their many cultural depictions as "swimmin<mark>g</mark> dinosaurs", mosasaurs were actually lizards, and ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs were even more distantly related to dinosaurs. Thou<mark>g</mark>h some dinosaurs were or are semiaquatic, (Hesperornis, Spinosaurus, auks, pen<mark>g</mark>uins), none are known to have been fully marine.[527][521][528][529]

Dimetrodon is often mistakenly called a dinosaur or considered to be a contemporary of dinosaurs in popular culture, but it became extinct some 40 million years before the first appearance of dinosaurs. Bein<mark>g</mark> a synapsid, Dimetrodon is actually more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs, birds, lizards, or other diapsids.[530][531][532][533]
Pterosaurs (sometimes referred to usin<mark>g</mark> the informal term pterodactyls) are often called "flyin<mark>g</mark> dinosaurs" by popular media and the <mark>g</mark>eneral public, but while pterosaurs were closely related to dinosaurs, dinosaurs are defined as the descendants of the last common ancestor of the Saurischia and the Ornithischia, which excludes the pterosaurs.[531][534]
Humans and avian dinosaurs currently coexist, but humans and non-avian dinosaurs did not coexist at any point.[535] The last of the non-avian dinosaurs died 66 million years a<mark>g</mark>o in the course of the Cretaceous–Paleo<mark>g</mark>ene extinction event, whereas the earliest members of the <mark>g</mark>enus Homo (humans) evolved between 2.3 and 2.4 million years a<mark>g</mark>o. This places a 63-million-year expanse of time between the last non-avian dinosaurs and the earliest humans. Humans did coexist with woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats: extinct mammals often erroneously depicted alon<mark>g</mark>side non-avian dinosaurs.[536]
Fossil fuels do not ori<mark>g</mark>inate from dinosaur fossils. Petroleum is formed when al<mark>g</mark>ae and zooplankton die and sink in anoxic conditions to be buried on the ocean floor without bein<mark>g</mark> decomposed by aerobic bacteria, and only a tiny amount of the world's deposits of coal contain dinosaur fossils; the vast majority of coal is fossilized plant matter.[537][538][539]
Mammals did not evolve from any modern <mark>g</mark>roup of reptiles; rather, mammals descend from a Reptiliomorph, "reptile-like," ancestor. The term reptile is problematic, since its conventional usa<mark>g</mark>e unnaturally excludes birds and mammals, and the modern consensus is that the reptiles are not a natural <mark>g</mark>roup.[540] After the first fully terrestrial tetrapods evolved, one of their linea<mark>g</mark>es split into the synapsids (the line leadin<mark>g</mark> to mammals) and the diapsids (the line leadin<mark>g</mark> to crocodiles, birds and other dinosaurs, tuatara, lizards, and snakes). The synapsids and the diapsids diver<mark>g</mark>ed about 320 million years a<mark>g</mark>o, in the mid-Carboniferous period.[541][542] Only later, in the Triassic, did the modern diapsid <mark>g</mark>roups (the lepidosaurs and the archosaurs) emer<mark>g</mark>e and diversify.[543][544] The mammals themselves are the only survivors of the synapsid line.[545]

Ae<mark>g</mark>yptopithecus, a prehistoric monkey predatin<mark>g</mark> the split between apes and other Old World monkeys durin<mark>g</mark> the course of human evolution. Ae<mark>g</mark>yptopithecus also postdates the division of the Old and New World monkeys, makin<mark>g</mark> it more closely related to humans than to all New World monkeys.[546]
Humans and other apes are Old World monkeys. The word monkey is often used colloquially to describe only those simians which possess tails, thus excludin<mark>g</mark> Barbary apes and true apes, but this distinction is taxonomically invalid.[547][548][549] While apes were traditionally thou<mark>g</mark>ht to be a sister <mark>g</mark>roup to monkeys, modern paleontolo<mark>g</mark>ical and molecular evidence shows that apes are deeply nested within the monkey family tree. Old World monkeys like baboons are more closely related to all apes than they are to all New World monkeys, and extinct Old World monkeys like Ae<mark>g</mark>yptopithecus predate the split between apes and all other extant Old World monkeys.[546][550] There is a concerted social and reli<mark>g</mark>ious effort to deny evidence which connects humans to their simian ancestors, but there is no way to naturally define the monkeys while excludin<mark>g</mark> humans and other apes.[547][551]
Humans did not evolve from either of the livin<mark>g</mark> species of chimpanzees (common chimpanzees and bonobos) or any other livin<mark>g</mark> species of apes.[552] Humans and chimpanzees did, however, evolve from a common ancestor.[553][554] This most recent common ancestor of livin<mark>g</mark> humans and chimpanzees would've lived between 5 and 8 million years a<mark>g</mark>o.[555] Extinct <mark>g</mark>reat apes such as Graecopithecus and Sahelanthropus tchadensis have been proposed as candidates for the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA), however, no fossil has yet conclusively been identified as the CHLCA.[556][557]

Glass does not flow at room temperature as a hi<mark>g</mark>h-viscosity liquid.[560] Althou<mark>g</mark>h <mark>g</mark>lass shares some molecular properties with liquids, it is a solid at room temperature and only be<mark>g</mark>ins to flow at hundreds of de<mark>g</mark>rees above room temperature.[561][562] Old <mark>g</mark>lass which is thicker at the bottom than at the top comes from the production process, not from slow flow;[561][562] no such distortion is observed in other <mark>g</mark>lass objects of similar or even <mark>g</mark>reater a<mark>g</mark>e.[561][562][563]
Most diamonds are not formed from hi<mark>g</mark>hly compressed coal. More than 99% of diamonds ever mined have formed in the conditions of extreme heat and pressure about 140 kilometers (87 mi) below the earth's surface. Coal is formed from prehistoric plants buried much closer to the surface, and is unlikely to mi<mark>g</mark>rate below 3.2 kilometers (2.0 mi) throu<mark>g</mark>h common <mark>g</mark>eolo<mark>g</mark>ical processes. Most diamonds that have been dated are older than the first land plants, and are therefore older than coal.[564]
Diamonds are not infinitely hard, and are subject to wear and scratchin<mark>g</mark>: althou<mark>g</mark>h they are the hardest known material on the Mohs Scale, they can be scratched by other diamonds[565] and worn down even by much softer materials, such as vinyl records.[566]

Computin<mark>g</mark> and the Internet
The macOS and Linux operatin<mark>g</mark> systems are not immune to malware such as trojan horses or computer viruses.[569] Specialized malware desi<mark>g</mark>ned to attack those systems do exist. However, the vast majority of viruses are developed for Microsoft Windows.[570]
The deep web is not primarily full of porno<mark>g</mark>raphy, ille<mark>g</mark>al dru<mark>g</mark> trade websites, and stolen bank details. This information is primarily found in a small portion of the deep web known as the "dark web". Much of the deep web consists of academic libraries, databases, and anythin<mark>g</mark> that is not indexed by normal search en<mark>g</mark>ines.[571]
Private browsin<mark>g</mark> (such as Chrome's "Inco<mark>g</mark>nito Mode") does not protect users from bein<mark>g</mark> tracked by websites, employers, <mark>g</mark>overnments, or one's internet service provider (ISP). Such entities can still use information such as IP addresses and user accounts to uniquely identify users.[572][573] Private browsin<mark>g</mark> also does not provide additional protection a<mark>g</mark>ainst viruses or malware.[574]

Total population livin<mark>g</mark> in extreme poverty, by world re<mark>g</mark>ion 1987 to 2015[578]
The total number of people livin<mark>g</mark> in extreme absolute poverty <mark>g</mark>lobally, by the widely used metric of $1.00/day (in 1990 U.S. dollars) has decreased over the last several decades, but most people surveyed in several countries incorrectly think it has increased or stayed the same.[579] However, this depends on the poverty line calculation used. For instance, if the metric used is instead one that prioritizes meetin<mark>g</mark> a standard life expectancy that no lon<mark>g</mark>er si<mark>g</mark>nificantly rises with additional consumption enabled by income, the number of individuals in poverty has risen by nearly 1 billion.[580][581]
Human population <mark>g</mark>rowth is decreasin<mark>g</mark> and the world population is expected to peak and then be<mark>g</mark>in fallin<mark>g</mark> durin<mark>g</mark> the 21st century. Improvements in a<mark>g</mark>ricultural productivity and technolo<mark>g</mark>y are expected to be able to meet anticipated increased demand for resources, makin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>lobal human overpopulation scenario unlikely.[582][583][584]
Monopolists do not try to sell items for the hi<mark>g</mark>hest possible price, nor do they try to maximize profit per unit, but rather they try to maximize total profit.[585]
For any <mark>g</mark>iven production set, there is not a set amount of labor input (a "lump of labor") to produce that output. This fallacy is commonly seen in Luddite and later, related movements as an ar<mark>g</mark>ument either that automation causes permanent, structural unemployment, or that labor-limitin<mark>g</mark> re<mark>g</mark>ulation can decrease unemployment. In fact, chan<mark>g</mark>es in capital allocation, efficiency, and economies of learnin<mark>g</mark> can chan<mark>g</mark>e the amount of labor input for a <mark>g</mark>iven set of production.[586]
Income is not a direct factor in determinin<mark>g</mark> credit score in the United States. Rather, credit score is impacted by the amount of unused available credit, which is in turn affected by income.[587] Income is also considered when evaluatin<mark>g</mark> creditworthiness more <mark>g</mark>enerally.
The US public vastly overestimates the amount spent on forei<mark>g</mark>n aid.[588]

The Earth's interior is not molten rock.

In fact, a solid with a lar<mark>g</mark>e Raylei<mark>g</mark>h number can also convect, <mark>g</mark>iven enou<mark>g</mark>h time, which is what occurs in the solid mantle due to the very lar<mark>g</mark>e thermal <mark>g</mark>radient across it.[613][614] There are small pockets of molten rock in the upper mantle, but these make up a tiny fraction of the mantle's volume.[615] The Earth's outer core is liquid, but it is liquid metal, not rock.[616]
The Amazon rainforest does not provide 20% of Earth's oxy<mark>g</mark>en.

Due to respiration by the resident or<mark>g</mark>anisms, all ecosystems (includin<mark>g</mark> the Amazon rainforest) have a net output of oxy<mark>g</mark>en of approximately zero. The oxy<mark>g</mark>en currently present in the atmosphere was accumulated over billions of years.[617]

Map of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape A<mark>g</mark>ulhas, the southernmost point of Africa
The Cape of Good Hope is not the southern tip of Africa, which is actually Cape A<mark>g</mark>ulhas, about 150 kilometres (90 mi) to the east-southeast.[618]
Rivers do not predominantly flow from north to south. Rivers flow downhill in all compass directions, often chan<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> direction alon<mark>g</mark> their course.[619][620] Indeed, many major rivers flow northward, includin<mark>g</mark> the Nile, the Yenisey, the Ob, the Rhine, the Lena, and the Orinoco.[621][622]

A widely held misconception in South Korea is that leavin<mark>g</mark> electric fans on while asleep can be fatal.
Sleepin<mark>g</mark> in a closed room with an electric fan runnin<mark>g</mark> does not result in "fan death", as is widely believed in South Korea.[623]
Wakin<mark>g</mark> up a sleepwalker does not harm them. Sleepwalkers may be confused or disoriented for a short time after awakenin<mark>g</mark>, but the health risks associated with sleepwalkin<mark>g</mark> are from injury or insomnia, not from bein<mark>g</mark> awakened.[624]
Drownin<mark>g</mark> is often inconspicuous to onlookers.[625] In most cases, the instinctive drownin<mark>g</mark> response prevents the victim from wavin<mark>g</mark> or yellin<mark>g</mark> (known as "aquatic distress"),[625] which are therefore not dependable si<mark>g</mark>ns of trouble; indeed, most drownin<mark>g</mark> victims under<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> the response do not show prior evidence of distress.[626]
Human blood in veins is not actually blue. Blood is red due to the presence of hemo<mark>g</mark>lobin; deoxy<mark>g</mark>enated blood (in veins) has a deep red color, and oxy<mark>g</mark>enated blood (in arteries) has a li<mark>g</mark>ht cherry-red color. Veins below the skin can appear blue or <mark>g</mark>reen due to subsurface scatterin<mark>g</mark> of li<mark>g</mark>ht throu<mark>g</mark>h the skin, and aspects of human color perception. Many medical dia<mark>g</mark>rams also use blue to show veins, and red to show arteries, which contributes to this misconception.[627]
Exposure to a vacuum, or experiencin<mark>g</mark> all but the most extreme uncontrolled decompression, does not cause the body to explode or internal fluids to boil (althou<mark>g</mark>h the fluids in the mouth and lun<mark>g</mark>s will indeed boil at altitudes above the Armstron<mark>g</mark> limit); rather, it will lead to a loss of consciousness once the body has depleted the supply of oxy<mark>g</mark>en in the blood, followed by death from hypoxia within minutes.[628]
Exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness is not caused by lactic acid build-up. Muscular lactic acid levels return to normal levels within an hour after exercise; delayed onset muscle soreness is thou<mark>g</mark>ht to be due to microtrauma from unaccustomed or strenuous exercise.[629]
Stretchin<mark>g</mark> before or after exercise does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness.[630]
Swallowin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>asoline does not <mark>g</mark>enerally require special emer<mark>g</mark>ency treatment, as lon<mark>g</mark> as it <mark>g</mark>oes into the stomach and not the lun<mark>g</mark>s, and inducin<mark>g</mark> vomitin<mark>g</mark> can make it worse.[631]

Sudden immersion into freezin<mark>g</mark> water does not typically cause death by hypothermia, but rather from the cold shock response, which can cause cardiac arrest, heart attack, or hyperventilation leadin<mark>g</mark> to drownin<mark>g</mark>.[633]
Cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fra<mark>g</mark>ments are swept out of the retort and pulverized by a machine called a cremulator (essentially a hi<mark>g</mark>h-capacity, hi<mark>g</mark>h-speed blender) to process them into "ashes" or "cremated remains".[634]
The lun<mark>g</mark>'s alveoli are not tiny balloons that expand and contract under positive pressure followin<mark>g</mark> the Youn<mark>g</mark>–Laplace equation, as is tau<mark>g</mark>ht in some physiolo<mark>g</mark>y and medical textbooks. The tissue structure is more like a spon<mark>g</mark>e with poly<mark>g</mark>onal spaces that unfold and fold under ne<mark>g</mark>ative pressure from the chest wall.[635]
Half of body heat is not lost throu<mark>g</mark>h the head, and coverin<mark>g</mark> the head is no more effective at preventin<mark>g</mark> heat loss than coverin<mark>g</mark> any other portion of the body. Heat is lost from the body in proportion to the amount of exposed skin.[636][637] The head accounts for around 7–9% of the body's surface, and studies have shown that havin<mark>g</mark> one's head submer<mark>g</mark>ed in cold water only causes a person to lose 10% more heat overall.[638] This myth likely comes from a flawed United States military experiment in 1950, involvin<mark>g</mark> a prototype Arctic survival suit where the head was one of the few body parts left exposed.[639] The misconception was further perpetuated by a 1970 military field manual that claimed "40–45%" of heat is lost throu<mark>g</mark>h the head, based on the 1950 study.[637][639]
Adrenochrome is not harvested from livin<mark>g</mark> people and has no use as a recreational dru<mark>g</mark>. Hunter S.

The five sta<mark>g</mark>es of <mark>g</mark>rief model is not supported in peer-reviewed research or objective clinical observation, let alone the idea that a precise number of sta<mark>g</mark>es of <mark>g</mark>rief exist at all.[645] The model was ori<mark>g</mark>inally based on uncredited work and ori<mark>g</mark>inally applied to the terminally ill instead of the <mark>g</mark>rievin<mark>g</mark> or bereaved.[646]
Althou<mark>g</mark>h bananas contain naturally occurrin<mark>g</mark> radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), which emit ionizin<mark>g</mark> radiation when under<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> radioactive decay, the levels of such radiation are far too low to induce radiation poisonin<mark>g</mark>, and bananas are not a radiation hazard. It would not be physically possible to eat enou<mark>g</mark>h bananas to cause radiation poisonin<mark>g</mark>, as the radiation dose from bananas is non-cumulative.[647][648][649][650] (See also: Banana equivalent dose)
Radiation is not always dan<mark>g</mark>erous. Radiation is ubiquitous on Earth's surface, and humans are adapted to survive at normal Earth radiation levels. Everythin<mark>g</mark> is safely non-toxic at sufficiently low doses, even deadly poisons and hi<mark>g</mark>h-ener<mark>g</mark>y forms of radiation, and everythin<mark>g</mark> becomes toxic at sufficiently hi<mark>g</mark>h doses, even water and oxy<mark>g</mark>en. Indeed, the relationship between dose and toxicity is often non-linear, and many substances that are toxic at hi<mark>g</mark>h doses have neutral or positive health effects, or are biolo<mark>g</mark>ically essential, at moderate or low doses. There is some evidence to su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>est that this is true for ionizin<mark>g</mark> radiation; normal levels of ionizin<mark>g</mark> radiation may serve to stimulate and re<mark>g</mark>ulate the activity of DNA repair mechanisms.[647][648][649][651]

The common cold and the common flu are caused by viruses, not cold temperature, althou<mark>g</mark>h cold temperature may somewhat weaken the immune system, and someone already infected with a cold or influenza virus but showin<mark>g</mark> no symptoms can become symptomatic after they are exposed to low temperatures.[652][653] Viruses are more likely to spread durin<mark>g</mark> the winter for a variety of reasons such as dry air, less air circulation in homes, people spendin<mark>g</mark> more time indoors, and lower vitamin D levels in humans.[654][655][656]
Antibiotics will not cure a cold; they treat bacterial diseases and are ineffectual a<mark>g</mark>ainst viruses.[657][658] However, they are sometimes prescribed to prevent or treat secondary infections.[659]
There is little to no evidence that any illnesses are curable throu<mark>g</mark>h essential oils or aromatherapy. Fish oil has not been shown to cure dementia, thou<mark>g</mark>h there is evidence to support the effectiveness of lemon oil as a way to reduce a<mark>g</mark>itation in patients with dementia.[660]
In those with the common cold, the color of the sputum or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to <mark>g</mark>reen and does not indicate the class of a<mark>g</mark>ent causin<mark>g</mark> the infection.[661]
Vitamin C does not prevent or treat the common cold, althou<mark>g</mark>h it may have a protective effect durin<mark>g</mark> intense cold-weather exercise.

There have never been any pro<mark>g</mark>rams in the US that provide access to dialysis machines in exchan<mark>g</mark>e for pull tabs on bevera<mark>g</mark>e cans.[666] This rumor has existed since at least the 1970s, and usually cites the National Kidney Foundation as the or<mark>g</mark>anization offerin<mark>g</mark> the pro<mark>g</mark>ram. The Foundation itself has denied the rumor, notin<mark>g</mark> that dialysis machines are primarily funded by Medicare.[667]
Hi<mark>g</mark>h dietary protein intake is not associated with kidney disease in healthy people.[668] While si<mark>g</mark>nificantly increased protein intake in the short-term is associated with chan<mark>g</mark>es in renal function, there is no evidence to su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>est this effect persists in the lon<mark>g</mark>-term and results in kidney dama<mark>g</mark>e or disease.[669]

Leprosy is not auto-de<mark>g</mark>enerative as commonly supposed, meanin<mark>g</mark> that it will not (on its own) cause body parts to be dama<mark>g</mark>ed or fall off.[671] Leprosy causes rashes to form and may de<mark>g</mark>rade cartila<mark>g</mark>e and, if untreated, inflame tissue. In addition, leprosy is only mildly conta<mark>g</mark>ious, partly because 95% of those infected with the mycobacteria that causes leprosy do not develop the disease.[672][671] Tzaraath, a Biblical disease that disfi<mark>g</mark>ures the skin is often identified as leprosy, and may be the source of many myths about the disease.[673]
Rust does not cause tetanus infection. The Clostridium tetani bacterium is <mark>g</mark>enerally found in dirty environments. Since the same conditions that harbor tetanus bacteria also promote rustin<mark>g</mark> of metal, many people associate rust with tetanus. C. tetani requires anoxic conditions to reproduce and these are found in the permeable layers of rust that form on oxy<mark>g</mark>en-absorbin<mark>g</mark>, unprotected ironwork.[674]
Quarantine has never been a standard procedure for those with severe combined immunodeficiency, despite the condition's popular nickname ("bubble boy syndrome") and its portrayal in films. A bone marrow transplant in the earliest months of life is the standard course of treatment. The exceptional case of David Vetter, who indeed lived much of his life encased in a sterile environment because he would not receive a transplant until a<mark>g</mark>e 12 (the transplant, because of failure to detect mononucleosis, instead killed Vetter), was one of the primary inspirations for the "bubble boy" trope.[675]
Gunnison, Colorado, did not avoid the 1918 flu pandemic by usin<mark>g</mark> protective sequestration. The implementation of protective sequestration did prevent the virus from spreadin<mark>g</mark> outside a sin<mark>g</mark>le household after a sin<mark>g</mark>le carrier came into the town while it was in effect, but it was not sustainable and had to be lifted in February 1919. A month later, the flu killed five residents and infected dozens of others.[676]
Statements in medication packa<mark>g</mark>e inserts listin<mark>g</mark> the frequency of side effects describe how often the effect occurs after takin<mark>g</mark> a dru<mark>g</mark>, but are not makin<mark>g</mark> any assertion that there is a causal connection between takin<mark>g</mark> the dru<mark>g</mark> and the occurrence of the side effect. In other words, what is bein<mark>g</mark> reported on is correlation, not necessarily causation.[677]
A do<mark>g</mark>'s mouth is not cleaner than a human's mouth. A do<mark>g</mark>'s mouth contains almost as much bacteria as a human mouth.[678][679]
There is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence that crystal healin<mark>g</mark> has any effect beyond actin<mark>g</mark> as a placebo.[680][681][682]

Drinkin<mark>g</mark> milk or consumin<mark>g</mark> other dairy products does not increase mucus production.[689] As a result, they do not need to be avoided by those with the flu or cold con<mark>g</mark>estion. However, milk and saliva in one's mouth mix to create a thick liquid that can briefly coat the mouth and throat. The sensation that lin<mark>g</mark>ers may be mistaken for increased phle<mark>g</mark>m.[690]
Drinkin<mark>g</mark> ei<mark>g</mark>ht <mark>g</mark>lasses (2–3 liters) of water a day is not needed to maintain health.[691] The amount of water needed varies by person, wei<mark>g</mark>ht, diet, activity level, clothin<mark>g</mark>, and the ambient heat and humidity. Water does not actually need to be drunk in pure form, and can be derived from liquids such as juices, tea, milk, soups, etc., and from foods includin<mark>g</mark> fruits and ve<mark>g</mark>etables.[691][692]
Drinkin<mark>g</mark> coffee and other caffeinated bevera<mark>g</mark>es does not cause dehydration for re<mark>g</mark>ular drinkers, althou<mark>g</mark>h it can for occasional drinkers.[693][692]
Su<mark>g</mark>ar does not cause hyperactivity in children.[694] Double-blind trials have shown no difference in behavior between children <mark>g</mark>iven su<mark>g</mark>ar-full or su<mark>g</mark>ar-free diets, even in studies specifically lookin<mark>g</mark> at children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or those considered sensitive to su<mark>g</mark>ar.[695] A 2019 meta-analysis found no positive effect of su<mark>g</mark>ar consumption on mood but did find an association with lower alertness and increased fati<mark>g</mark>ue within an hour of consumption, known as a su<mark>g</mark>ar crash.[696]
Eatin<mark>g</mark> nuts, popcorn, or seeds does not increase the risk of diverticulitis.[697] These foods may actually have a protective effect.[698]
Eatin<mark>g</mark> less than an hour before swimmin<mark>g</mark> does not increase the risk of experiencin<mark>g</mark> muscle cramps or drownin<mark>g</mark>. One study shows a correlation between alcohol consumption and drownin<mark>g</mark>, but not between eatin<mark>g</mark> and stomach cramps.[699]
Ve<mark>g</mark>an and ve<mark>g</mark>etarian diets can provide enou<mark>g</mark>h protein for adequate nutrition.[700] In fact, typical protein intakes of ovo-lacto ve<mark>g</mark>etarians meet or exceed requirements.[701] It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned ve<mark>g</mark>etarian diets are healthful.[702] However, a ve<mark>g</mark>an diet does require supplementation of vitamin B12,[700] and vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of ve<mark>g</mark>ans that do not supplement their diet.[703] Consumin<mark>g</mark> no animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B12 and D, calcium, iron, ome<mark>g</mark>a-3 fatty acids,[704] and sometimes iodine.[705] Ve<mark>g</mark>ans are also at risk of low bone mineral density without supplementation for the aforementioned nutrients.[706]
Swallowed chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um does not take seven years to di<mark>g</mark>est. In fact, chewin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>um is mostly indi<mark>g</mark>estible, and passes throu<mark>g</mark>h the di<mark>g</mark>estive system at the same rate as other matter.[707]
Monosodium <mark>g</mark>lutamate (MSG) does not tri<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er mi<mark>g</mark>raine headaches or other symptoms of so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome, nor is there evidence that some individuals are especially sensitive to MSG. There is also little evidence it impacts body wei<mark>g</mark>ht.[708]
Spicy food or coffee do not have a si<mark>g</mark>nificant effect on the development of peptic ulcers.[709]
The beta carotene in carrots does not enhance ni<mark>g</mark>ht vision beyond normal levels for people receivin<mark>g</mark> an adequate amount, only in those with a deficiency of vitamin A.[710] The belief that it does may have ori<mark>g</mark>inated from World War II British disinformation meant to explain the Royal Air Force's improved success in ni<mark>g</mark>ht battles, which was actually due to radar and the use of red li<mark>g</mark>hts on instrument panels.[711]
Spinach is not a particularly <mark>g</mark>ood source of dietary iron. While it does contain more iron than many ve<mark>g</mark>etables such as aspara<mark>g</mark>us, Swiss chard, kale, or aru<mark>g</mark>ula, it contains only about one-third to one-fifth of the iron in lima beans, chickpeas, apricots, or wheat <mark>g</mark>erm. Additionally, the non-heme iron found in spinach and other ve<mark>g</mark>etables is not as readily absorbed as the heme iron found in meats and fish.[712][713][714]
Most cases of obesity are not related to slower restin<mark>g</mark> metabolism. Restin<mark>g</mark> metabolic rate does not vary much between people. Overwei<mark>g</mark>ht people tend to underestimate the amount of food they eat, and underwei<mark>g</mark>ht people tend to overestimate. In fact, overwei<mark>g</mark>ht people tend to have faster metabolic rates due to the increased ener<mark>g</mark>y required by the lar<mark>g</mark>er body.[715]
Eatin<mark>g</mark> normal amounts of soy does not cause hormonal imbalance.[716]
Alcoholic bevera<mark>g</mark>es
Alcoholic bevera<mark>g</mark>es do not make the entire body warmer.[717] Alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth because they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endin<mark>g</mark>s near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in makin<mark>g</mark> the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchan<mark>g</mark>e with a cold external environment.[718]
Alcohol does not necessarily kill brain cells.[719] Alcohol can, however, lead indirectly to the death of brain cells in two ways. First, in chronic, heavy alcohol users whose brains have adapted to the effects of alcohol, abrupt ceasin<mark>g</mark> followin<mark>g</mark> heavy use can cause excitotoxicity leadin<mark>g</mark> to cellular death in multiple areas of the brain.[720] Second, in alcoholics who <mark>g</mark>et most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff's syndrome, which is associated with serious brain dama<mark>g</mark>e.[721]
The order in which different types of alcoholic bevera<mark>g</mark>es are consumed ("Grape or <mark>g</mark>rain but never the twain" and "Beer before liquor never sicker; liquor before beer in the clear") does not affect intoxication or create adverse side effects.[722]
Absinthe has no hallucino<mark>g</mark>enic properties, and is no more dan<mark>g</mark>erous than any other alcoholic bevera<mark>g</mark>e of equivalent proof.[723] This misconception stems from late-19th- and early-20th-century distillers who produced cheap knockoff versions of absinthe, which used copper salts to recreate the distinct <mark>g</mark>reen color of true absinthe, and some also reportedly adulterated cheap absinthe with poisonous antimony trichloride, reputed to enhance the louchin<mark>g</mark> effect.[724]

It is not possible to <mark>g</mark>et pre<mark>g</mark>nant from semen released in a swimmin<mark>g</mark> pool without penetration. The sperm cells would be quickly killed by the chlorinated water and would not survive lon<mark>g</mark> enou<mark>g</mark>h to reach the va<mark>g</mark>ina.[725]
A broken hymen is not a reliable indicator that a female has been va<mark>g</mark>inally penetrated, because the tearin<mark>g</mark> of the hymen may have been the result of some other event,[726][727] and bleedin<mark>g</mark> is not necessarily associated with the first va<mark>g</mark>inal sexual intercourse. Traditional vir<mark>g</mark>inity tests, such as the "two-fin<mark>g</mark>er" test, are widely considered to be unscientific.[728][729] Reliable forensic methods of determinin<mark>g</mark> whether sexual intercourse has occurred do exist; biolo<mark>g</mark>ical evidence such as semen, blood, va<mark>g</mark>inal secretions, saliva, and va<mark>g</mark>inal epithelial cells may all be identified and <mark>g</mark>enetically typed, and the information derived from such analyses can often help determine whether sexual contact occurred, as well as provide information re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> the circumstances of the incident.[730]
Hand size[731] and foot size[732] do not correlate with human penis size, but fin<mark>g</mark>er len<mark>g</mark>th ratio may.[733]
While pre<mark>g</mark>nancies from sex between first cousins do carry a sli<mark>g</mark>htly elevated risk of birth defects, this risk is often exa<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>erated.[734] The risk is 5–6% (similar to that of a woman in her early 40s <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> birth),[734][735] compared with a baseline risk of 3–4%.[735] The effects of inbreedin<mark>g</mark> depression, while still relatively small compared to other factors (and thus difficult to control for in a scientific experiment), become more noticeable if isolated and maintained for several <mark>g</mark>enerations.[736]
Havin<mark>g</mark> sex before a sportin<mark>g</mark> event or contest is not physiolo<mark>g</mark>ically detrimental to performance.[737] In fact it has been su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ested that sex prior to sports activity can elevate male testosterone levels, which could potentially enhance performance for male athletes.[738]
There is no definitive proof of the existence of the va<mark>g</mark>inal G-spot, and the <mark>g</mark>eneral consensus is that no such spot exists on the female body.[739]
Closeted or latent homosexuality is not correlated with internalized homophobia. A 1996 study claimin<mark>g</mark> a connection in men[740] has not been verified by subsequent studies, includin<mark>g</mark> a 2013 study that found no correlation.[741]
The menstrual cycles of women who live to<mark>g</mark>ether do not tend to synchronize. A 1971 study made this claim, but subsequent research has not supported it.[742][743]
The onset of puberty is not be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> earlier than it did historically. The avera<mark>g</mark>e onset of a child's <mark>g</mark>rowth spurt typically occurred between a<mark>g</mark>es 10–12.[744] Menarche also occurred at a similar ran<mark>g</mark>e as today, between 12–14 years of a<mark>g</mark>e. However, markers such as menarche may have experienced a retardation at the be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> of modern times due to a deterioration in livin<mark>g</mark> conditions and nutrition. In those situations, menarche was often delayed to 15 or 16 years of a<mark>g</mark>e.[745]

Water-induced wrinkles are not caused by the skin absorbin<mark>g</mark> water and swellin<mark>g</mark>.[746] They are caused by the autonomic nervous system, which tri<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ers localized vasoconstriction in response to wet skin, yieldin<mark>g</mark> a wrinkled appearance.[747]
A person's hair and fin<mark>g</mark>ernails do not continue to <mark>g</mark>row after death. Rather, the skin dries and shrinks away from the bases of hairs and nails, <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> the appearance of <mark>g</mark>rowth.[748]
Shavin<mark>g</mark> does not cause terminal hair to <mark>g</mark>row back thicker or darker. This belief is thou<mark>g</mark>ht to be due to the fact that hair that has never been cut has a tapered end, so after cuttin<mark>g</mark>, the base of the hair is blunt and appears thicker and feels coarser. That short hairs are less flexible than lon<mark>g</mark>er hairs contributes to this effect.[749]
Hair care products cannot actually "repair" split ends and dama<mark>g</mark>ed hair. They can prevent dama<mark>g</mark>e from occurrin<mark>g</mark> in the first place, and they can also smooth down the cuticle in a <mark>g</mark>lue-like fashion so that it appears repaired, and <mark>g</mark>enerally make hair appear in better condition.[750]
Pullin<mark>g</mark> or cuttin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>rey hair will not cause two <mark>g</mark>rey hairs to <mark>g</mark>row in its place. It will only cause the one hair to <mark>g</mark>row back because only one hair can <mark>g</mark>row from each follicle.[751]
MC1R, the <mark>g</mark>ene mostly responsible for red hair, is not becomin<mark>g</mark> extinct, nor will the <mark>g</mark>ene for blond hair do so, althou<mark>g</mark>h both are recessive alleles. Redheads and blonds may become rarer but will not die out unless everyone who carries those alleles dies without passin<mark>g</mark> their hair color <mark>g</mark>enes on to their children.[752]
Acne is mostly caused by <mark>g</mark>enetics, and is not caused by a lack of hy<mark>g</mark>iene or eatin<mark>g</mark> fatty foods, thou<mark>g</mark>h certain medication or a carbohydrate-rich diet may worsen it.[753]
Dandruff is not caused by poor hy<mark>g</mark>iene, thou<mark>g</mark>h infrequent hair-washin<mark>g</mark> can make it more obvious. The exact causes of dandruff are uncertain, but they are believed to be mostly <mark>g</mark>enetic and environmental factors.[754]

James Watt did not invent the steam en<mark>g</mark>ine,[755] nor were his ideas on steam en<mark>g</mark>ine power inspired by a kettle lid pressured open by steam.[756] Watt improved upon the already commercially successful Newcomen atmospheric en<mark>g</mark>ine (invented in 1712) in the 1760s and 1770s, makin<mark>g</mark> certain improvements critical to its future usa<mark>g</mark>e, particularly the external condenser, increasin<mark>g</mark> its efficiency, and later the mechanism for transformin<mark>g</mark> reciprocatin<mark>g</mark> motion into rotary motion; his new steam en<mark>g</mark>ine later <mark>g</mark>ained hu<mark>g</mark>e fame as a result.[757]
Althou<mark>g</mark>h the <mark>g</mark>uillotine was named after the French physician Joseph-I<mark>g</mark>nace Guillotin, he neither invented nor was executed with this device. He died peacefully in his own bed in 1814.[758]
Thomas Crapper did not invent the flush toilet.[759] A forerunner of the modern toilet was invented by the Elizabethan courtier Sir John Harin<mark>g</mark>ton in the 16th century,[760] and in 1775 the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummin<mark>g</mark> developed and patented a desi<mark>g</mark>n for a toilet with an S-trap and flushin<mark>g</mark> mechanism.[761] Crapper, however, did much to increase the popularity of the flush toilet and introduced several innovations in the late 19th century, holdin<mark>g</mark> nine patents, includin<mark>g</mark> one for the floatin<mark>g</mark> ballcock.[762] The word crap is also not derived from his name (see the Words, phrases and lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>es section above).[763]
Thomas Edison did not invent the li<mark>g</mark>ht bulb.[764] He did, however, develop the first practical li<mark>g</mark>ht bulb in 1880 (employin<mark>g</mark> a carbonized bamboo filament), shortly prior to Joseph Swan, who invented an even more efficient bulb in 1881 (which used a cellulose filament).
Henry Ford did not invent either the automobile or the assembly line. He did improve the assembly line process substantially, sometimes throu<mark>g</mark>h his own en<mark>g</mark>ineerin<mark>g</mark> but more often throu<mark>g</mark>h sponsorin<mark>g</mark> the work of his employees, and he was the main person behind the introduction of the Model T, re<mark>g</mark>arded as the first affordable automobile.[765] Karl Benz (co-founder of Mercedes-Benz) is credited with the invention of the first modern automobile,[766] and the assembly line has existed throu<mark>g</mark>hout history.
Al Gore never said that he had "invented" the Internet. What Gore actually said was, "Durin<mark>g</mark> my service in the United States Con<mark>g</mark>ress, I took the initiative in creatin<mark>g</mark> the Internet", in reference to his political work towards developin<mark>g</mark> the Internet for widespread public use.[767] Gore was the ori<mark>g</mark>inal drafter of the Hi<mark>g</mark>h Performance Computin<mark>g</mark> and Communication Act of 1991, which provided si<mark>g</mark>nificant fundin<mark>g</mark> for supercomputin<mark>g</mark> centers,[768] and this in turn led to up<mark>g</mark>rades of a major part of the already-existin<mark>g</mark> early 1990s Internet backbone, the NSFNet,[769] and development of NCSA Mosaic, the browser that popularized the World Wide Web.[768] (See also: Al Gore and information technolo<mark>g</mark>y)

Marble bust of a man with a lon<mark>g</mark>, pointed beard, wearin<mark>g</mark> a taenia, a kind of ancient Greek head coverin<mark>g</mark> in this case resemblin<mark>g</mark> a turban. The face is somewhat <mark>g</mark>aunt and has prominent, but thin, eyebrows, which seem halfway fixed into a scowl. The ends of his mustache are lon<mark>g</mark> a trail halfway down the len<mark>g</mark>th of his beard to about where the bottom of his chin would be if we could see it. None of the hair on his head is visible, since it is completely covered by the taenia.
Bust of Pytha<mark>g</mark>oras in the Capitoline Museums, Rome.[770] Classical historians dispute whether he ever made any mathematical discoveries.[771][772]
The Greek philosopher Pytha<mark>g</mark>oras was not the first to discover the equation expressed in the Pytha<mark>g</mark>orean theorem, as it was known and used by the Babylonians and Indians centuries before him.[773][774][775][776] Pytha<mark>g</mark>oras may have been the first to introduce it to the Greeks,[777][775] but the first record of it bein<mark>g</mark> mathematically proven as a theorem is in Euclid's Elements which was published some 200 years after Pytha<mark>g</mark>oras.
There is no evidence that the ancient Greeks deliberately desi<mark>g</mark>ned the Parthenon to match the <mark>g</mark>olden ratio.[778] The Parthenon was completed in 438 BCE, more than a century before the first recorded mention of the ratio by Euclid. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man makes no mention of the <mark>g</mark>olden ratio in its text, althou<mark>g</mark>h it describes many other proportions.[779]
The repeatin<mark>g</mark> decimal commonly written as 0.999... represents exactly the same quantity as the number one. Despite havin<mark>g</mark> the appearance of representin<mark>g</mark> a smaller number, 0.999... is a symbol for the number 1 in exactly the same way that 0.333... is an equivalent notation for the number represented by the fraction 1⁄3.[780]
The p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, or the probability that the alternative hypothesis is false; it is the probability of obtainin<mark>g</mark> results at least as extreme as the results actually observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis was correct, which can indicate the incompatibility of results with the specific statistical model assumed in the null hypothesis.[781] This misconception, and similar ones like it, contributes to the common misuse of p-values in education and research.[781][782]
If one were to flip a fair coin five times and <mark>g</mark>et heads each time, it would not be any more likely for a sixth flip to come up tails. Phrased another way, after a lon<mark>g</mark> and/or unlikely streak of independently random events, the probability of the next event is not influenced by the precedin<mark>g</mark> events. Humans often feel that the underrepresented outcome is more likely, as if it is due to happen. Such thinkin<mark>g</mark> may be attributed to the mistaken belief that <mark>g</mark>amblin<mark>g</mark>, or even chance itself, is a fair process that can correct itself in the event of streaks.[783]

The lift force is not <mark>g</mark>enerated by the air takin<mark>g</mark> the same time to travel above and below an aircraft's win<mark>g</mark>.[784] This misconception, sometimes called the equal transit-time fallacy, is widespread amon<mark>g</mark> textbooks and non-technical reference books, and even appears in pilot trainin<mark>g</mark> materials. In fact, the air movin<mark>g</mark> over the top of an aerofoil <mark>g</mark>eneratin<mark>g</mark> lift is always movin<mark>g</mark> much faster than the equal transit theory would imply,[784] as described in the incorrect and correct explanations of lift force.
Blowin<mark>g</mark> over a curved piece of paper does not demonstrate Bernoulli's principle. Althou<mark>g</mark>h a common classroom experiment is often explained this way,[785] Bernoulli's principle only applies within a flow field, and the air above and below the paper is in different flow fields.[786] The paper rises because the air follows the curve of the paper and a curved streamline will develop pressure differences perpendicular to the airflow.[787][788]
The Coriolis effect does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction dependin<mark>g</mark> on the hemisphere. The common myth often refers to the drainin<mark>g</mark> action of flush toilets and bathtubs. In fact, rotation is determined by whatever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain, as the ma<mark>g</mark>nitude of the coriolis acceleration is ne<mark>g</mark>li<mark>g</mark>ibly small compared to the inertial acceleration of flow within a typical basin.[789]
Neither <mark>g</mark>yroscopic forces nor <mark>g</mark>eometric trail are required for a rider to balance a bicycle or for it to demonstrate self-stability.[790][791] Althou<mark>g</mark>h <mark>g</mark>yroscopic forces and trail can be contributin<mark>g</mark> factors, it has been demonstrated that those factors are neither required nor sufficient by themselves.[790]
A penny dropped from the Empire State Buildin<mark>g</mark> would not kill a person or crack the sidewalk. A penny is too li<mark>g</mark>ht and has too much air resistance to acquire enou<mark>g</mark>h speed to do much dama<mark>g</mark>e since it reaches terminal velocity after fallin<mark>g</mark> about 50 feet. Heavier or more aerodynamic objects could cause si<mark>g</mark>nificant dama<mark>g</mark>e if dropped from that hei<mark>g</mark>ht.[792][793]
Usin<mark>g</mark> a pro<mark>g</mark>rammable thermostat's setback feature to limit heatin<mark>g</mark> or coolin<mark>g</mark> in a temporarily unoccupied buildin<mark>g</mark> does not waste as much ener<mark>g</mark>y as leavin<mark>g</mark> the temperature constant. Usin<mark>g</mark> setback saves ener<mark>g</mark>y (5–15%) because heat transfer across the surface of the buildin<mark>g</mark> is rou<mark>g</mark>hly proportional to the temperature difference between its inside and the outside.[794][795]
It is not possible for a person to completely submer<mark>g</mark>e in quicksand, as commonly depicted in fiction,[796] althou<mark>g</mark>h sand entrapment in the nearshore of a body of water can be a drownin<mark>g</mark> hazard as the tide rises.[797]
Quantum nonlocality caused by quantum entan<mark>g</mark>lement does not allow faster-than-li<mark>g</mark>ht communication or imply instant action at a distance, despite its common characterization as "spooky action at a distance". Rather, it means that certain experiments cannot be explained by local realism.[798][799]
The slipperiness of ice is not due to pressure meltin<mark>g</mark>. While it is true that increased pressure, such as that exerted by someone standin<mark>g</mark> on a sheet of ice, will lower the meltin<mark>g</mark> point of ice, experiments show that the effect is too weak to account for the lowered friction. Materials scientists still debate whether premeltin<mark>g</mark> or the heat of friction is the dominant cause of ice's slipperiness.[800][801]
Psycholo<mark>g</mark>y and neuroscience
A small number of youn<mark>g</mark> children have eidetic memory, where they can recall an object with hi<mark>g</mark>h precision for a few minutes after it is no lon<mark>g</mark>er present.[802] True photo<mark>g</mark>raphic memory (the ability to remember endless ima<mark>g</mark>es, particularly pa<mark>g</mark>es or numbers, with such a hi<mark>g</mark>h de<mark>g</mark>ree of precision that the ima<mark>g</mark>e mimics a photo) has never been demonstrated to exist in any individual.[803] Many people have claimed to have a photo<mark>g</mark>raphic memory, but those people have been shown to have hi<mark>g</mark>h precision memories as a result of mnemonic devices rather than a natural capacity for detailed memory encodin<mark>g</mark>.[804] There are rare cases of individuals with exceptional memory, but none of them have a memory that mimics that of a camera.
The phase of the Moon does not influence fertility, cause a fluctuation in crime, or affect the stock market.

However, the increased amount of illumination durin<mark>g</mark> the full moon may account for increased epileptic episodes, motorcycle accidents, or sleep disorders.[805]

Dyslexia is not defined or dia<mark>g</mark>nosed as mirror writin<mark>g</mark> or readin<mark>g</mark> letters or words backwards.[807][808] Mirror writin<mark>g</mark> and readin<mark>g</mark> letters or words backwards are behaviors seen in many children (dyslexic or not) as they learn to read and write.[807][808] Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of people who have at least avera<mark>g</mark>e intelli<mark>g</mark>ence and who have difficulty in readin<mark>g</mark> and writin<mark>g</mark> that is not otherwise explained by low intelli<mark>g</mark>ence.[809]
Self-harm is not <mark>g</mark>enerally an attention-seekin<mark>g</mark> behavior. People who en<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>e in self-harm are typically very self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel <mark>g</mark>uilty about their behavior, leadin<mark>g</mark> them to <mark>g</mark>o to <mark>g</mark>reat len<mark>g</mark>ths to conceal it from others.[810] They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothin<mark>g</mark>.[811][812]
There is no evidence that a chemical imbalance or neurotransmitter deficiency is the sole factor in depression and other mental disorders, but rather a combination of biolo<mark>g</mark>ical, psycholo<mark>g</mark>ical, and social factors.[813][814]
Schizophrenia is characterized by continuous or relapsin<mark>g</mark> episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (typically hearin<mark>g</mark> voices), delusions, paranoia, and disor<mark>g</mark>anized thinkin<mark>g</mark>. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and apathy.[815] The term was coined from the Greek roots schizein and phrēn, "to split" and "mind", in reference to a "splittin<mark>g</mark> of mental functions" seen in schizophrenia, not a splittin<mark>g</mark> of the personality.[816] It does not involve split or multiple personalities—a split or multiple personality is dissociative identity disorder.[817]
Not all pedophiles commit child sexual abuse, and usin<mark>g</mark> the psychiatric definition of the word pedophile, not all child sexual abuse is committed by pedophiles. Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. Child sexual abuse, also called child molestation, is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation. In <mark>g</mark>eneral usa<mark>g</mark>e, a pedophile is any adult who is sexually attracted to or en<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>es in sexual acts with a child.[818]

Broad <mark>g</mark>eneralizations are often made in popular psycholo<mark>g</mark>y about certain brain functions bein<mark>g</mark> lateralized, or more predominant in one hemisphere than the other. These claims are often inaccurate or overstated.[819]
The human brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, does not reach "full maturity" at any particular a<mark>g</mark>e (e.<mark>g</mark>. 18, 21, or 25 years of a<mark>g</mark>e). Chan<mark>g</mark>es in structure and myelination of <mark>g</mark>ray matter are recorded to continue with relative consistency all throu<mark>g</mark>hout adult life.

People do not use only 10% of their brains.[822][823] While it is true that a small minority of neurons in the brain are actively firin<mark>g</mark> at any one time, a healthy human will normally use most of their brain over the course of a day, and the inactive neurons are important as well. The idea that activatin<mark>g</mark> 100% of the brain would allow someone to achieve their maximum potential and/or <mark>g</mark>ain various psychic abilities is common in folklore and fiction,[823][824][825] but doin<mark>g</mark> so in real life would likely result in a fatal seizure.[826][827] This misconception was attributed to late 19th century leadin<mark>g</mark> thinker William James, who apparently used the expression only metaphorically.[824]

An incorrect map of the ton<mark>g</mark>ue showin<mark>g</mark> zones that taste bitter (1), sour (2), salty (3) and sweet (4). Actually, all zones can sense all tastes, and there is also the taste of umami (not shown on picture).
All different tastes can be detected on all parts of the ton<mark>g</mark>ue by taste buds,[831] with sli<mark>g</mark>htly increased sensitivities in different locations dependin<mark>g</mark> on the person; the ton<mark>g</mark>ue map showin<mark>g</mark> the contrary is fallacious.[832]

Humans have more than the commonly cited five senses. The number of senses in various cate<mark>g</mark>orizations ran<mark>g</mark>es from five to more than 20. In addition to si<mark>g</mark>ht, smell, taste, touch, and hearin<mark>g</mark>, which were the senses identified by Aristotle, humans can sense balance and acceleration (equilibrioception), pain (nociception), body and limb position (proprioception or kinesthetic sense), and relative temperature (thermoception).[837] Other senses sometimes identified are the sense of time, echolocation, itchin<mark>g</mark>, pressure, hun<mark>g</mark>er, thirst, fullness of the stomach, need to urinate, need to defecate, and blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.[838][839]
The human sense of smell is not weak or underdeveloped. Humans have similar senses of smell to other mammals, and are more sensitive to some odors than rodents and do<mark>g</mark>s.[840]

The Bermuda Trian<mark>g</mark>le does not have any more shipwrecks or mysterious disappearances than most other waterways.[841]
Toilet waste is never intentionally jettisoned from an aircraft. All waste is collected in tanks and emptied into toilet waste vehicles.[842] Blue ice is caused by accidental leaka<mark>g</mark>e from the waste tank. Passen<mark>g</mark>er train toilets, on the other hand, have indeed historically flushed onto the tracks; modern trains in most developed countries usually have retention tanks on board and therefore do not dispose of waste in such a manner.
Automotive batteries stored on a concrete floor do not dischar<mark>g</mark>e any faster than they would on other surfaces,[843] in spite of worry amon<mark>g</mark> Americans that concrete harms batteries.[844] Early batteries with porous, leaky cases may have been susceptible to moisture from floors, but for many years lead–acid car batteries have had impermeable polypropylene cases.[845] While most modern automotive batteries are sealed, and do not leak battery acid when properly stored and maintained,[846] the sulfuric acid in them can leak out and stain, etch, or corrode concrete floors if their cases crack or tip over or their vent-holes are breached by floods.[847]

 In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, Bart Ehrman wrote, "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, a<mark>g</mark>rees".[158] Richard A. Burrid<mark>g</mark>e states: "There are those who ar<mark>g</mark>ue that Jesus is a fi<mark>g</mark>ment of the Church's ima<mark>g</mark>ination, that there never was a Jesus at all. I have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that any more".[159] Robert M. Price does not believe that Jesus existed, but a<mark>g</mark>rees that this perspective runs a<mark>g</mark>ainst the views of the majority of scholars.[160] James D. G. Dunn calls the theories of Jesus' non-existence "a thorou<mark>g</mark>hly dead thesis".[161] Michael Grant (a classicist) wrote in 1977, "In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposin<mark>g</mark> of the much stron<mark>g</mark>er, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary".[162] Robert E. Van Voorst states that biblical scholars and classical historians re<mark>g</mark>ard theories of non-existence of Jesus as effectively refuted.[163] Writin<mark>g</mark> on The Daily Beast, Candida Moss and Joel Baden state that "there is ni<mark>g</mark>h universal consensus amon<mark>g</mark> biblical scholars – the authentic ones, at least – that Jesus was, in fact, a real <mark>g</mark>uy".[164]

Nonetheless, the number of distinct words you can derive from them is not 50, or 150, or 1500, or a million, but simply unbounded. Only stamina sets a limit.
b. The seven most common En<mark>g</mark>lish words for snow are snow, hail, sleet, ice, icicle, slush, and snowflake. En<mark>g</mark>lish also has the related word <mark>g</mark>lacier and the four common skiin<mark>g</mark> terms pack, powder, crud, and crust, so one can say that at least 12 distinct words for snow exist in En<mark>g</mark>lish.

 David Robson, New Scientist 2896, December 18 2012, Are there really 50 Eskimo words for snow?, "Yet I<mark>g</mark>or Krupnik, an anthropolo<mark>g</mark>ist at the Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center in Washin<mark>g</mark>ton DC believes that Boas was careful to include only words representin<mark>g</mark> meanin<mark>g</mark>ful distinctions. Takin<mark>g</mark> the same care with their own work, Krupnik and others have now charted the vocabulary of about 10 Inuit and Yupik dialects and conclude that there are indeed many more words for snow than in En<mark>g</mark>lish (SIKU: Knowin<mark>g</mark> Our Ice, 2010). Central Siberian Yupik has 40 such terms, whereas the Inuit dialect spoken in Nunavik, Quebec, has at least 53, includin<mark>g</mark> matsaaruti, wet snow that can be used to ice a slei<mark>g</mark>h's runners, and pukak, for the crystalline powder snow that looks like salt. For many of these dialects, the vocabulary associated with sea ice is even richer."

 a. Beilby & Rhodes Eddy 2009, pp. 38–39: "Contrary to previous times, virtually everyone in the field today acknowled<mark>g</mark>es that Jesus was considered by his contemporaries to be an exorcist and a worker of miracles. However, when it comes to historical assessment of the miracles tradition itself, the consensus quickly shatters. Some, followin<mark>g</mark> in the footsteps of Bultmann, embrace an explicit methodolo<mark>g</mark>ical naturalism such that the very idea of a miracle is ruled out a priori. Others defend the lo<mark>g</mark>ical possibility of miracle at the theoretical level, but, in practice, retain a functional methodolo<mark>g</mark>ical naturalism, maintainin<mark>g</mark> that we could never be in possession of the type and/or amount of evidence that would justify a historical jud<mark>g</mark>ment in favor of the occurrence of a miracle. Still others, suspicious that an uncompromisin<mark>g</mark> methodolo<mark>g</mark>ical naturalism most likely reflects an unwarranted metaphysical naturalism, find such a priori skepticism unwarranted and either remain open to, or even explicitly defend, the historicity of miracles within the Jesus tradition."
b. Vermes 2001, ch.8 "By the end of the first century Christianity had lost si<mark>g</mark>ht of the real Jesus and of the ori<mark>g</mark>inal meanin<mark>g</mark> of his messa<mark>g</mark>e. Paul, John and their churches replaced him by the otherworldy Christ of faith."
c. Ehrman 2012, pp. 13, 298, 334–335: "The problem with the historical Jesus for Schweitzer was that he was in fact all too historical. That is, Jesus was so firmly rooted in his own time and place, that he does not translate to modern idiom. The Jesus proclaimed by preachers and theolo<mark>g</mark>ians today had no existence. That particular Jesus is (or those particular Jesuses are) a myth. But there was a historical Jesus, who was very much a man of his time."
d. Ehrman 2012, pp. 268–270: "As I have repeatedly emphasized, different scholars come to radically different conclusions about how to understand the life of the historical Jesus...Nearly all critical scholars a<mark>g</mark>ree at least on those points about the historical Jesus. But there is obviously a lot more to say, and that is where scholarly disa<mark>g</mark>reements loom lar<mark>g</mark>e - disa<mark>g</mark>reements not over whether Jesus existed but over what kind of Jewish teacher and preacher he was."
e. Levine 2006, pp. 1: "No sin<mark>g</mark>le picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most, scholars; all methods and their combinations find their critics as well as their advocates."

<mark>g</mark>. Watson 2001, p. 168: "All this su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ests that the relationship between Christian faith and historical research is to be seen as an on<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> critical dialo<mark>g</mark>ue about Jesus and his si<mark>g</mark>nificance. There is no pre-established harmony between the two sides, and the hope for an eventual consensus is in current circumstances utopian. But neither is this a purely ne<mark>g</mark>ative relationship of absolute anta<mark>g</mark>onism or indifference. The dialo<mark>g</mark>ue may at least serve to clarify why it is that for some Jesus is one of the prophets, whereas for others he is the Christ. Each side in the dialo<mark>g</mark>ue remains an unresolved problem to the other—and, as such, an opportunity to learn somethin<mark>g</mark> new."

[Note 4:] Althou<mark>g</mark>h it remains a frin<mark>g</mark>e phenomenon, familiarity with the Christ myth theory has become much more widespread amon<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>eneral public with the advent of the Internet."
c. Larry Hurtado (December 2, 2017), Why the "Mythical Jesus" Claim Has No Traction with Scholars: "The "mythical Jesus" view doesn't have any traction amon<mark>g</mark> the overwhelmin<mark>g</mark> number of scholars workin<mark>g</mark> in these fields, whether they be declared Christians, Jewish, atheists, or undeclared as to their personal stance. Advocates of the "mythical Jesus" may dismiss this statement, but it ou<mark>g</mark>ht to count for somethin<mark>g</mark> if, after some 250 years of critical investi<mark>g</mark>ation of the historical fi<mark>g</mark>ure of Jesus and of Christian Ori<mark>g</mark>ins, and the due consideration of "mythical Jesus" claims over the last century or more, this spectrum of scholars have jud<mark>g</mark>ed them unpersuasive (to put it mildly)."

e. Bart Ehrman (2012), Did Jesus Exist?, p.20: "It is fair to say that mythicists as a <mark>g</mark>roup, and as individuals, are not taken seriously by the vast majority of scholars in the fields of New Testament, early Christianity, ancient history, and theolo<mark>g</mark>y.

 "Peein<mark>g</mark> on a Jellyfish Stin<mark>g</mark>: Does It Help or Hurt?". October 10, 2019. There is no truth to the myth that peein<mark>g</mark> on a jellyfish stin<mark>g</mark> can make it feel better. Numerous studies have found that this simply doesn't work.
One of the possible reasons that this myth became popular could be due to the fact that urine contains compounds like ammonia and urea. If used alone, these substances may be helpful for some stin<mark>g</mark>s. But your pee contains a lot of water. And all that water dilutes the ammonia and urea too much to be effective.
What's more, the sodium in your urine, to<mark>g</mark>ether with the velocity of the urine stream could move the stin<mark>g</mark>ers around in the injury. This could tri<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er the stin<mark>g</mark>ers to release even more venom.

This is because the biokinetic model for potassium used in this document represents the relatively slow removal of potassium (biolo<mark>g</mark>ical half-time 30 days) that is estimated to occur for typical intakes of potassium, whereas an elevated intake of potassium would result in excretion of a nearly equal mass of natural potassium, and hence of 40K, over a short period."

The literature about Biodiversity and the GE food/feed consumption has sometimes resulted in animated debate re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> the suitability of the experimental desi<mark>g</mark>ns, the choice of the statistical methods or the public accessibility of data. Such debate, even if positive and part of the natural process of review by the scientific community, has frequently been distorted by the media and often used politically and inappropriately in anti-GE crops campai<mark>g</mark>ns.

Currently available trans<mark>g</mark>enic crops and foods derived from them have been jud<mark>g</mark>ed safe to eat and the methods used to test their safety have been deemed appropriate. These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Or<mark>g</mark>anization (WHO, 2002).

PMID 21546547. There is broad scientific consensus that <mark>g</mark>enetically en<mark>g</mark>ineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. After 14 years of cultivation and a cumulative total of 2 billion acres planted, no adverse health or environmental effects have resulted from commercialization of <mark>g</mark>enetically en<mark>g</mark>ineered crops (Board on A<mark>g</mark>riculture and Natural Resources, Committee on Environmental Impacts Associated with Commercialization of Trans<mark>g</mark>enic Plants, National Research Council and Division on Earth and Life Studies 2002). Both the U.S. National Research Council and the Joint Research Centre (the European Union's scientific and technical research laboratory and an inte<mark>g</mark>ral part of the European Commission) have concluded that there is a comprehensive body of knowled<mark>g</mark>e that adequately addresses the food safety issue of <mark>g</mark>enetically en<mark>g</mark>ineered crops (Committee on Identifyin<mark>g</mark> and Assessin<mark>g</mark> Unintended Effects of Genetically En<mark>g</mark>ineered Foods on Human Health and National Research Council 2004; European Commission Joint Research Centre 2008).

In spite of this, the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of GM plants is still limited. However, it is important to remark that for the first time, a certain equilibrium in the number of research <mark>g</mark>roups su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>estin<mark>g</mark>, on the basis of their studies, that a number of varieties of GM products (mainly maize and soybeans) are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-GM plant, and those raisin<mark>g</mark> still serious concerns, was observed. Moreover, it is worth mentionin<mark>g</mark> that most of the studies demonstratin<mark>g</mark> that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breedin<mark>g</mark>, have been performed by biotechnolo<mark>g</mark>y companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializin<mark>g</mark> these GM plants. Anyhow, this represents a notable advance in comparison with the lack of studies published in recent years in scientific journals by those companies. Krimsky, Sheldon (2015).

The presented articles su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>estin<mark>g</mark> possible harm of GMOs received hi<mark>g</mark>h public attention. However, despite their claims, they actually weaken the evidence for the harm and lack of substantial equivalency of studied GMOs. We emphasize that with over 1783 published articles on GMOs over the last 10 years it is expected that some of them should have reported undesired differences between GMOs and conventional crops even if no such differences exist in reality.

b. Feil, Max. The Aeronautics File. As an example, take the misleadin<mark>g</mark> experiment most often used to "demonstrate" Bernoulli's principle. Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your fin<mark>g</mark>er, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even thou<mark>g</mark>h you are blowin<mark>g</mark> air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasin<mark>g</mark> its pressure by forcin<mark>g</mark> it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even thou<mark>g</mark>h the air on the top is movin<mark>g</mark> faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure accordin<mark>g</mark> to Bernoulli.
