Duterte and his administration were embroiled in controversy followin<mark>g</mark> the cessation of TV and radio broadcast operations of ABS-CBN, the lar<mark>g</mark>est media network in the country.

Early in his presidential tenure, Duterte made efforts to distance the Philippines from the United States, and for<mark>g</mark>e closer relationships with China and Russia, particularly in economic and military cooperation.[704] Duterte expressed his intention to scale back military a<mark>g</mark>reements with the United States,[705][706] and to conduct joint military exercises with China's People's Liberation Army.[707] Duterte also sou<mark>g</mark>ht to source weapons from China and Russia after the U.S. State Department refused to sell assault rifles to the Philippine police due to human ri<mark>g</mark>hts violations concerns relatin<mark>g</mark> to the dru<mark>g</mark> war.[708]

Duterte's approval ratin<mark>g</mark> remained relatively hi<mark>g</mark>h throu<mark>g</mark>hout his presidency despite criticism and international opposition to his anti-narcotics drive.[823] Two weeks into Duterte's presidency, on July 13, 2016, Social Weather Stations (SWS) conducted the first approval survey since his inau<mark>g</mark>uration; Duterte received an "excellent" trust ratin<mark>g</mark> of 79% amon<mark>g</mark> 1,200 Filipino adults.[824][825] A week later, Pulse Asia released a poll conducted on July 2–8 showin<mark>g</mark> 91% of Filipinos trusted Duterte, makin<mark>g</mark> him the most-trusted official in the Philippines since 1999.[826][827] Duterte's net-satisfaction was at its lowest value 45% in July 2018;[828] it recovered to 54% in September 2018[829] and 60% in December that year.[830]

The line between home plate and first base that be<mark>g</mark>ins 45 feet down the first base line and extends past first base. The rules state that if the batter-runner is in the path of a throw that ori<mark>g</mark>inates near home plate and is outside the area created by the base line and the 45-foot line, he shall be called out if the umpire believes he interfered with the play. If he remains within the line, he cannot be called out for interference. This rule is desi<mark>g</mark>ned to allow catchers and pitchers the ability to field bunts and throw the batter-runner out without havin<mark>g</mark> to worry about the batter-runner intentionally or unintentionally interferin<mark>g</mark> with the throw.
This line is also used to decide whether a pickoff move is le<mark>g</mark>al or a balk. If the pitcher steps with his lead foot towards the base he intends to throw to it is considered le<mark>g</mark>al; the 45-foot line determines whether that step is towards the base or towards home plate. This only comes into play when the pickoff move is to the base the pitcher naturally faces, i.e. third for a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-hander or first for a lefty.

The infielders' practice of throwin<mark>g</mark> the ball to each other after recordin<mark>g</mark> an out, provided there are no runners on base. The purpose is as much traditional as anythin<mark>g</mark>, but it serves as a way to celebrate the out. Typically, if an out is made at first base, the first baseman will throw to the shortstop, who throws to the second baseman, who throws to the third baseman, who returns the ball to the pitcher. Patterns vary from team to team, but the third baseman is usually the last infielder to receive a throw, re<mark>g</mark>ardless of the pattern.
Throwin<mark>g</mark> the ball around the horn is also done after a strikeout with no baserunners. The catcher will throw the ball to the third baseman, who then throws it to the second baseman, who throws it to the shortstop, who then throws it to the first baseman. Some catchers, such as Iván Rodrí<mark>g</mark>uez, prefer to throw the ball to the first baseman, who then be<mark>g</mark>ins the process in reverse. Some catchers determine to whom they will throw based on the handedness of the batter (to first for a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed batter because the line to the first baseman is not blocked and vice versa) or whether the team is in an overshift, when the third baseman would be playin<mark>g</mark> close to where the shortstop normally plays and would require a harder throw to be reached.
An additional application of this term is when a 5-4-3 double play has occurred, which mimics the pattern of throwin<mark>g</mark> the ball around the horn.

A slan<mark>g</mark> term for a baseball record that is disputed in popular opinion (i.e., unofficially) because of a perception that the record holder had an unfair advanta<mark>g</mark>e in attainin<mark>g</mark> the record. It implies that the record requires a footnote explainin<mark>g</mark> the purportedly unfair advanta<mark>g</mark>e, with the asterisk bein<mark>g</mark> a symbol commonly used in typo<mark>g</mark>raphy to call out footnotes. In recent times it has been prominently used in the followin<mark>g</mark> circumstances:
The record holder is widely believed to have used performance-enhancin<mark>g</mark> dru<mark>g</mark>s, whether or not such use is proven or admitted. Barry Bonds was re<mark>g</mark>ularly <mark>g</mark>reeted with banners and si<mark>g</mark>ns bearin<mark>g</mark> an asterisk durin<mark>g</mark> the 2007 season when he broke Hank Aaron's career home run record. The ball Bonds hit for the record-breakin<mark>g</mark> home run was subsequently branded with an asterisk before it was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
A holder of a sin<mark>g</mark>le-season record accomplished the feat in a lon<mark>g</mark>er season, and thus had additional opportunities to break the record. A well-known example of this was when Ro<mark>g</mark>er Maris broke Babe Ruth's sin<mark>g</mark>le-season home run record on the last day of a 162-<mark>g</mark>ame re<mark>g</mark>ular season in 1961, while Ruth set the previous record in a 154-<mark>g</mark>ame season in 1927; the asterisk usa<mark>g</mark>e is exemplified in the title of the film 61*, which was about Maris' quest to break Ruth's record. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick declared that Maris's record should be listed separately from Ruth's (contrary to popular belief no asterisk was mentioned or used in this case), a decision not formally reversed until 1991.

Note that a plate appearance is not recorded as an "at-bat" if the batter reaches first base as a result of a base on balls, or hit by pitch, nor if he executes a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly.
Occasionally a batter may be at the plate when the third out of the innin<mark>g</mark> is made a<mark>g</mark>ainst a base-runner; in this case the batter will lead off the next innin<mark>g</mark> with a clean strike count and his interrupted plate appearance is not counted as an at-bat.

A pitch that crosses the plate at the hei<mark>g</mark>ht of the letters of the team's name on the shirt of the batter's uniform is said to be "at the letters", "letter-hi<mark>g</mark>h" or "chest-hi<mark>g</mark>h".

A batted ball in fair territory which bounces out of play (e.<mark>g</mark>. into the seats) entitles the batter and all runners on base to advance two bases but no further. This term is used by some commentators in lieu of <mark>g</mark>round rule double, which refers to <mark>g</mark>round rules in effect at each ballpark.

backdoor breakin<mark>g</mark> ball
A breakin<mark>g</mark> pitch, usually a slider, curveball, or cut fastball that, due to its lateral motion, passes throu<mark>g</mark>h a small part of the strike zone on the outside ed<mark>g</mark>e of the plate after seemin<mark>g</mark> as if it would miss the plate entirely. It may not cross the front of the plate but only the back and thus have come in throu<mark>g</mark>h the "back door". A slider is the most common version, because a slider has more lateral motion than other breakin<mark>g</mark> pitches (it curves down and 'slides' across the zone).

A rulin<mark>g</mark> made by an umpire a<mark>g</mark>ainst a pitchin<mark>g</mark> motion that violates rules intended to prevent the pitcher from unfairly deceivin<mark>g</mark> a baserunner. When a balk is called, each runner can freely advance one base. In professional baseball, a balk does not instantly result in a dead ball. If a pitch is thrown and all runners advance one base due to a hit, play continues and the balk is i<mark>g</mark>nored. This rarely occurs because when the balk is called the pitcher normally stops his delivery and the umpire declares the ball dead and awards the bases. In non-professional baseball (hi<mark>g</mark>h school and colle<mark>g</mark>e), a balk instantly results in a dead ball and the runners are awarded their bases. The rules specify which pitchin<mark>g</mark> movements are ille<mark>g</mark>al. Commonly called balks are failure for the pitcher to come to a set position (or comin<mark>g</mark> set multiple times) or failure to step in the direction of the base he is throwin<mark>g</mark> toward. The spirit of a balk is that certain movements mean the pitcher has be<mark>g</mark>un the pitch, so the runner cannot then be picked off. Some balks result from errant or unsuccessful motions, such as when the ball slips out of the pitcher's hand. Far more rare is a catcher's balk, when the catcher moves from behind the area of the plate before the pitcher starts his delivery (applicable only durin<mark>g</mark> an intentional walk).

In sabermetrics, "ball in play" and "battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e on balls in play" (BABIP) have specific technical definitions that are used to determine pitchers' ability independently of the fieldin<mark>g</mark> defense of a team.

A ball hit forcefully into the <mark>g</mark>round near home plate, producin<mark>g</mark> a bounce hi<mark>g</mark>h above the head of a fielder.[18] This <mark>g</mark>ives the batter time to reach first base safely before the ball can be fielded. An important element of Baltimore Orioles coach John McGraw's "inside baseball" strate<mark>g</mark>y, the technique was popularized durin<mark>g</mark> Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball's dead-ball era, durin<mark>g</mark> which baseball teams could not rely on the home run.[19]
To <mark>g</mark>ive the maximum bounce to a Baltimore chop, Orioles <mark>g</mark>roundskeeper Tom Murphy packed the dirt ti<mark>g</mark>htly around home plate, mixed it with hard clay and left the infield unwatered.[20] Speedy Orioles players like McGraw, Joe Kelley, Steve Brodie, and Willie Keeler most often practiced and perfected it.
In modern baseball, the Baltimore chop is much less common, usually resultin<mark>g</mark> when a batter accidentally swin<mark>g</mark>s over the ball. The result is sometimes more pronounced on those diamonds with artificial turf. The technique still sees use in softball.[21]

A solid-colored, usually dark area beyond the center field wall that is the visual backdrop for the batter lookin<mark>g</mark> out at the pitcher. It allows the batter to see the pitched ball a<mark>g</mark>ainst a dark and uncluttered back<mark>g</mark>round, as much for the batter's safety as anythin<mark>g</mark>. The use of a batter's back<mark>g</mark>round has been standard in baseball (as well as cricket where they are called "si<mark>g</mark>ht screens") since at least the late 1800s.
One example of a batter's back<mark>g</mark>round is the black area in center field of the first Yankee Stadium. At one time there were seats in that section, but because of distractions the seats were removed and the area was painted black.

A rectan<mark>g</mark>le on either side of home plate in which the batter must be standin<mark>g</mark> for fair play to resume. A foot and a hand out of the box are not sufficient to stop play (althou<mark>g</mark>h pitchers will usually respect a batter's wish to step out of the box). The umpire must <mark>g</mark>rant the batter a timeout before play is stopped.

The pitcher and catcher considered as a sin<mark>g</mark>le unit, who may also be called batterymen[31] or batterymates of one another. The use of this word was first coined by Henry Chadwick in the 1860s in reference to the firepower of a team's pitchin<mark>g</mark> staff and inspired by the artillery batteries then in use in the American Civil War.[32] Later, the term evolved to indicate the combined effectiveness of pitcher and catcher.[32][33]

battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e
Main article: battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e (baseball)
Battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e (BA) is the avera<mark>g</mark>e number of hits per at-bat (BA=H/AB). A perfect battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e would be 1.000 (read: "one thousand"). A battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e of .300 ("three hundred") is considered to be excellent, which means the best hitters fail to <mark>g</mark>et a hit in 70% of their at-bats. Even the level of .400, which is outstandin<mark>g</mark> and rare (last achieved at the major lea<mark>g</mark>ue level in 1941), su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ests "failure" 60% of the time. Bases on balls are not counted in calculatin<mark>g</mark> battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e. This is part of the reason OBP is now re<mark>g</mark>arded by "fi<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er filberts" as a truer measure of a hitter's worth at the plate. In 1887, there was an experiment with includin<mark>g</mark> bases-on-balls as hits (and as at-bats) in computin<mark>g</mark> the battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e. It was effectively an early attempt at an OBP, but it was re<mark>g</mark>arded as a "marketin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>immick" and was dropped after the one year. It eventually put Cap Anson in limbo re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> his career hits status; droppin<mark>g</mark> the bases on balls from his 1887 stats, as some encyclopedias do, put his career number of hits below the benchmark 3,000 total.

A blown save (BS) is char<mark>g</mark>ed to a relief pitcher who enters a <mark>g</mark>ame in a save situation but allows the tyin<mark>g</mark> run to score. If the pitcher further allows the winnin<mark>g</mark> run to score, he is char<mark>g</mark>ed with both a loss and a blown save. If, after blowin<mark>g</mark> the save, the pitcher's team re<mark>g</mark>ains the lead, the pitcher may also be credited with the win. The blown save is not an officially reco<mark>g</mark>nized statistic by Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball, but is reco<mark>g</mark>nised by the Rolaids Relief Man Award, which char<mark>g</mark>es two points a<mark>g</mark>ainst a reliever's record for a blown save opportunity. It is often used on broadcasts to characterize the "record" of closers analo<mark>g</mark>ous to win–loss records of starters. "Jones has made 31 out of 34 saves" or "Jones has 31 saves and three blown saves."

Bu<mark>g</mark>s Bunny chan<mark>g</mark>e-up
A chan<mark>g</mark>e-up pitch that appears to arrive at homeplate so slowly that a batter can make three swin<mark>g</mark>s and misses on a sin<mark>g</mark>le pitch. Whiff-whiff-whiff, three strikes and the batter is out. The reference is to Bu<mark>g</mark>s Bunny, the animated cartoon character, who is depicted employin<mark>g</mark> such a pitch in the cartoon Baseball Bu<mark>g</mark>s. As Trevor Hoffman's chan<mark>g</mark>eup evolved into an all-world weapon, his pitchin<mark>g</mark> teammates were in awe of it, much like many hitters were. They liked it so much, they <mark>g</mark>ave it a nickname. They called it the Bu<mark>g</mark>s Bunny Pitch.

"Bullpen" can be used to describe the area in which these Tampa Bay Rays relief pitchers are sittin<mark>g</mark> or as a metonym for the pitchers themselves.
The area used by pitchers and catchers to warm up before takin<mark>g</mark> the mound when play has already be<mark>g</mark>un. This area is usually off to the side alon<mark>g</mark> either the left or ri<mark>g</mark>ht base line, or behind an outfield fence. It is almost never in fair territory, presumably due to the risk of interference with live action. A rare exception was at New York's Polo Grounds where the bullpens were in the deep left and ri<mark>g</mark>ht center field quarter-circles of the outfield wall.
A team's relief pitchin<mark>g</mark> corps (so named because the relievers are in the bullpen durin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>ames).

To deliberately bat the ball weakly to a particular spot on the infield by holdin<mark>g</mark> the bat nearly still, with one hand behind the sweet spot (q.v. under bat) and lettin<mark>g</mark> the ball hit it. Typically, a bunt is used to advance other runners and is then referred to as a sacrifice or a sacrifice hit or a sacrifice bunt. When done correctly, fielders have no play except, at best, to throw the batter-runner out at first base.
Speedy runners also bunt for base hits when infielders are playin<mark>g</mark> back. In such a situation, left-handed hitters may use a dra<mark>g</mark> bunt, in which they start steppin<mark>g</mark> towards first base while completin<mark>g</mark> the bunt swin<mark>g</mark>. Even the <mark>g</mark>reat slu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er Mickey Mantle would dra<mark>g</mark> bunt once in a while, takin<mark>g</mark> advanta<mark>g</mark>e of his 3.1 second speed from home to first base. Currently, Ryan Zimmerman of the Nationals is notable in that he is a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed hitter who uses dra<mark>g</mark> bunts successfully.

A hi<mark>g</mark>h, easy-to-catch, fly ball hit to the outfield. The phrase is said to have ori<mark>g</mark>inated in the nineteenth-century and relates to an old-time <mark>g</mark>rocer's method of <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> canned <mark>g</mark>oods down from a hi<mark>g</mark>h shelf. Usin<mark>g</mark> a stick with a hook on the end, a <mark>g</mark>rocer could tip a can so it would fall for an easy catch into his apron. One theory for use of corn as the canned <mark>g</mark>ood in the phrase is that a can of corn was considered the easiest "catch" as corn was the best sellin<mark>g</mark> ve<mark>g</mark>etable in the store and so was heavily stocked on the lowest shelves. Another theory is that the corn refers to the practice in the very early days of baseball of callin<mark>g</mark> the outfield the "corn field", especially in early amateur baseball where the outfield may have been a farm field. Frequently used by Red Barber, a variation, 'A #8 CAN OF GOLDEN BANTAM' was favored by Bob Prince, Pittsbur<mark>g</mark>h Pirates' announcer. The phrase was also used by Yankee announcer Phil Rizzuto, Red Sox and then White Sox broadcaster Ken "The Hawk" Harrelson, and Blue Jays broadcaster and former mana<mark>g</mark>er Buck Martinez as voiced in the popular video <mark>g</mark>ame Triple Play 2000. Also, a phrase used to refer to somethin<mark>g</mark> that is not challen<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark>. Informally, can of corn may be used as a phrase to describe mild excitement, personal acknowled<mark>g</mark>ement or reco<mark>g</mark>nition of si<mark>g</mark>nificance.

When a pitcher quickly dispatches a batter with three or four pitches that the batter only whiffs at, the pitcher may be said to have "carved up the batter" – like a chef carvin<mark>g</mark> up a turkey. Headline: "How Buehrle carved up Tampa Bay with just one 90-m.p.h. pitch."[53]

A desirable or auspicious situation. Popularized by Red Barber, lon<mark>g</mark>time broadcaster for the Brooklyn Dod<mark>g</mark>ers. James Thurber wrote in his short story of the same title: "[S]ittin<mark>g</mark> in the catbird seat" means sittin<mark>g</mark> pretty, like a batter with three balls and no strikes on him. The catbird is said to seek out the hi<mark>g</mark>hest point in a tree to sin<mark>g</mark> his son<mark>g</mark>, so someone in the catbird seat is hi<mark>g</mark>h up.

As if a batter were runnin<mark>g</mark> a footrace with a fastball, he's said to "catch up" to a fastball if his reaction time and bat speed are quick enou<mark>g</mark>h to hit a fastball by a power pitcher. "Our scoutin<mark>g</mark> reports indicate he can still hit and still catch up to a fastball.

It is catcher's interference when the catcher physically hinders the batter's opportunity to swin<mark>g</mark> at a pitch. In professional baseball, play continues and after continuous playin<mark>g</mark> action ceases, the umpire calls time. The penalty is that the batter is awarded first base; any runner attemptin<mark>g</mark> to steal is awarded that base and all other runners advance only if forced. The mana<mark>g</mark>er of the offensive team has the option of keepin<mark>g</mark> the result of the play. He will not be <mark>g</mark>iven the option by the umpires and must explicitly declare it before the play continues after awardin<mark>g</mark> bases. The catcher is char<mark>g</mark>ed with an error. This is one of many types of interference call.
cau<mark>g</mark>ht looking
From Open-site.or<mark>g</mark>: A term used when the third strike is called on a batter without the batter attemptin<mark>g</mark> to swin<mark>g</mark> at the pitch.
cau<mark>g</mark>ht napping
A baserunner who is ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out because he wasn't payin<mark>g</mark> attention to what the defensive players were doin<mark>g</mark> is "cau<mark>g</mark>ht nappin<mark>g</mark>". Often this involves a pickoff play in which the infielder sneaks up behind the runner and takes a throw from the pitcher or, less often, the catcher.

Specifically re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> a batter: A seat on the bench, as opposed to reachin<mark>g</mark> base or remainin<mark>g</mark> in the batter's box. As in, "throw him the chair". The expression is an encoura<mark>g</mark>ement to the pitcher to strike out the batter, sendin<mark>g</mark> him back to the du<mark>g</mark>out, thus "throwin<mark>g</mark> him the chair"—forcin<mark>g</mark> him to sit down.
challen<mark>g</mark>e the hitter
When a pitcher is a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressive and throws strikes, perhaps his best fastball, he may be said to "challen<mark>g</mark>e the hitter". Akin to poundin<mark>g</mark> the strike zone or attackin<mark>g</mark> the strike zone. "Jared has outstandin<mark>g</mark> stuff", Mee said. "The one thin<mark>g</mark> I would like to see him do is throw more strikes and challen<mark>g</mark>e the hitters. He has a lot of ability and when he is ahead in the count he's a very difficult <mark>g</mark>uy to hit off of."[56]
chan<mark>g</mark>e the eye level
A pitcher "chan<mark>g</mark>es the eye level" of a hitter by throwin<mark>g</mark> pitches at different hei<mark>g</mark>hts in the strike zone. This is intended to keep the hitter off-balance or uncomfortable. "Chan<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the eye-level of a hitter is important because as you advance, it'll become more difficult for you to <mark>g</mark>et a hitter to move his feet in the batters box – even by pitchin<mark>g</mark> inside – so the next option is to move the hitter's eyes."[57]
chan<mark>g</mark>eup
Main article: chan<mark>g</mark>eup
A chan<mark>g</mark>eup or a chan<mark>g</mark>e is a pitch meant to look like a fastball - but with less velocity - short for chan<mark>g</mark>e of pace. A variety of this pitch is the circle chan<mark>g</mark>e, where a circle is formed usin<mark>g</mark> the thumb and index fin<mark>g</mark>er on the last third of a ball. This causes the ball to break inside and down to ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed batter from a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed pitcher, frequently resultin<mark>g</mark> in <mark>g</mark>round balls. Also, a strai<mark>g</mark>ht chan<mark>g</mark>e - made famous by Pedro Martínez - can be utilized. The <mark>g</mark>rip requires all fin<mark>g</mark>ers to be used in holdin<mark>g</mark> the ball, resultin<mark>g</mark> in more friction, thus slowin<mark>g</mark> the ball down tremendously.
char<mark>g</mark>e
When an infielder runs towards a <mark>g</mark>round ball rather than wait for it to come to him.
Runs are said to be "char<mark>g</mark>ed" to the pitcher who initially allowed the scorin<mark>g</mark> runner to <mark>g</mark>et on base.
char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the mound
Main article: Char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the mound
Char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the mound refers to a batter assaultin<mark>g</mark> the pitcher after bein<mark>g</mark> hit by a pitch or in some cases after narrowly avoidin<mark>g</mark> bein<mark>g</mark> hit. The first incident of a professional char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the mound has not been identified but the practice certainly dates back to the <mark>g</mark>ame's early days. Char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the mound is often the precipitatin<mark>g</mark> cause of a bench-clearin<mark>g</mark> brawl and will most likely result in the batter's ejection.

To chase (or chase after) is to swin<mark>g</mark> at a pitch well outside of the strike zone.
A pitcher who is removed from the <mark>g</mark>ame by the mana<mark>g</mark>er because he <mark>g</mark>ave up too many runs is said to have been "chased from the <mark>g</mark>ame" or "chased from the mound" by the opposin<mark>g</mark> batters. "Pettitte was chased from the <mark>g</mark>ame in the seventh innin<mark>g</mark> followin<mark>g</mark> an RBI sin<mark>g</mark>le by Willy Taveras and a two-RBI triple by Kazuo Matsui."[58]
A player or coach who is ejected from the <mark>g</mark>ame by an umpire can be said to be chased. "Martin was tossed by umpire Lee Weyer in the fourth <mark>g</mark>ame of the 1976 Series, seven years after Weaver was chased by Sha<mark>g</mark> Crawford in the fourth <mark>g</mark>ame in 1969."[59]

A batter checks a swin<mark>g</mark> by stoppin<mark>g</mark> it before the bat crosses the front of home plate. If he fails to stop it in time, the umpire will call a strike because he swun<mark>g</mark> at the pitch. Often the umpire's view of the swin<mark>g</mark> is obstructed. If the umpire calls the pitch a ball, a defensive player such as the catcher or pitcher can ask the home plate umpire to ask another umpire whether the batter swun<mark>g</mark> at the pitch. In such a case, the home plate umpire always accepts the jud<mark>g</mark>ment of the other umpire. "Basically, the Ti<mark>g</mark>ers tied the Sox in knots the entire <mark>g</mark>ame—or else they wouldn't have had as many checked swin<mark>g</mark>s as they did. Or as many strikes that they tried to sell to the umpires as balls."[61]

A fastball, particularly one that is difficult to hit. A fastball hi<mark>g</mark>h in the strike zone is also called hi<mark>g</mark>h cheese, and one low in the zone can be called cheese at the knees. 'Easy Cheese' refers to the seemin<mark>g</mark>ly effortless motion of a pitcher as he throws a fastball at very hi<mark>g</mark>h velocity.

An older term for a home run, often a hi<mark>g</mark>h fly ball, that barely clears the fence at that part of the outfield closest to the plate. It was frequently used in reference to such hits at the Polo Grounds, former home of the New York Giants, which had notoriously short foul lines. Its use has declined since that stadium was demolished, and even further as it has been perceived as ethnically offensive.[62]
A secondary sense is that of a lon<mark>g</mark> fly ball, usually one that travels backward from home plate. This usa<mark>g</mark>e appears to be restricted to sandlot ball <mark>g</mark>ames in New En<mark>g</mark>land, where it may have evolved from a supposed "Chaney's home run", a backward foul by a player of that name who eventually won a <mark>g</mark>ame for the hittin<mark>g</mark> team when the ball, the last one available, could not be found. The umpire then ruled that the other team failed to provide an adequate number of balls and had thus forfeited the <mark>g</mark>ame.[62]

A chopper refers to a batted ball that immediately strikes the hardened area of dirt directly in front of home plate, causin<mark>g</mark> it to bounce hi<mark>g</mark>h into the infield. Batters who are fast runners can convert such choppers into base hits. Also a batted ball that bounces several times before either bein<mark>g</mark> fielded by an infielder or reachin<mark>g</mark> the outfield. Former Braves broadcaster Skip Caray often whimsically called bouncers to third base when Atlanta was on defense as "a chopper to Chipper" in reference to lon<mark>g</mark>-time Braves third baseman Chipper Jones.

When a batter hits a ball throu<mark>g</mark>h the infield without its bein<mark>g</mark> touched by a fielder, he may be said to have a "clean hit". Similarly, if a batter hits a ball over an outfielder's head, he may have a "clean hit". "Tris truly loved to hit and would always <mark>g</mark>et a thrill when <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> a 'clean' hit that travelled over an outfielder's head."[64]

complete <mark>g</mark>ame
Main article: Complete <mark>g</mark>ame
A complete <mark>g</mark>ame (denoted by CG) is the act of a pitcher pitchin<mark>g</mark> an entire <mark>g</mark>ame himself, without the benefit of a relief pitcher. A complete <mark>g</mark>ame can be either a win or a loss. A complete <mark>g</mark>ame can be awarded to a pitcher even if he pitches less than (or more than) nine innin<mark>g</mark>s, as lon<mark>g</mark> as he pitches the entire <mark>g</mark>ame.

A hitter who does not strike out often. Thus, he's usually able to make contact with the ball and put it in play. This doesn't mean he's necessarily a pitty-patty slap hitter. He may hit for power, but typically with more doubles/triples instead of home runs. Pete Rose, Tony Gwynn, and Wade Bo<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>s are all excellent examples of contact hitters.

The number of balls and strikes a batsman has in his current at-bat. Usually announced as a pair of numbers, for instance "3–0" (pronounced "three and oh"), with the first number bein<mark>g</mark> the number of balls and the second bein<mark>g</mark> the number of strikes. A 3–2 count – one with the maximum number of balls and strikes in a <mark>g</mark>iven at bat – is referred to as a full count. A count of 1–1 or 2–2 is called even, althou<mark>g</mark>h the pitcher is considered to have the advanta<mark>g</mark>e on a 2–2 pitch because he can still throw another ball without consequence, whereas another strike means the batter is out. A batter is said to be ahead in the count (and a pitcher behind in the count) if the count is 1–0, 2–0, 2–1, 3–0, or 3–1. A batter is said to be behind in the count (and a pitcher ahead in the count) if the count is 0–1, 0–2, or 1–2.

A count of 1–1 or 2–2 is called even, althou<mark>g</mark>h the pitcher is considered to have the advanta<mark>g</mark>e on a 2–2 pitch because he can still throw another ball without consequence, whereas another strike means the batter is out. A batter is said to be ahead in the count (and a pitcher behind in the count) if the count is 1–0, 2–0, 2–1, 3–0, or 3–1. A batter is said to be behind in the count (and a pitcher ahead in the count) if the count is 0–1, 0–2, or 1–2.
coverin<mark>g</mark> a base
Main article: Coverin<mark>g</mark> a base
Part of the infielders' job is to cover bases. That is, stand next to a base in anticipation of receivin<mark>g</mark> the ball from another fielder, then make a play on a baserunner who is approachin<mark>g</mark> that base. On a force play or an appeal play, the fielder coverin<mark>g</mark> a base stands with one foot on that base when he catches the ball.
When a fielder <mark>g</mark>oes to make a play at a base that is not his position (usually because the fielder for that base is unavailable to catch the ball at that base because he is busy fieldin<mark>g</mark> the batted ball). A common example is when the first baseman fields a batted <mark>g</mark>round ball, but is too far from the base to put the runner out. The pitcher runs over to "cover" first base to take the throw from the first baseman (play would be scored as "3-1", meanin<mark>g</mark> first baseman to pitcher).

The sound of the bat hittin<mark>g</mark> the ball. The term is used in baseball to mean "immediately, without hesitation". For example, a baserunner may start runnin<mark>g</mark> "on the crack of the bat", as opposed to waitin<mark>g</mark> to see where the ball <mark>g</mark>oes.
Outfielders often use the sound of bat-meetin<mark>g</mark>-ball as a clue to how far a ball has been hit. As physicist Robert Adair has written, "When a baseball is hit strai<mark>g</mark>ht at an outfielder he cannot quickly jud<mark>g</mark>e the an<mark>g</mark>le of ascent and the distance the ball will travel. If he waits until the trajectory is well defined, he has waited too lon<mark>g</mark> and will not be able to reach otherwise catchable balls. If he starts quickly, but misjud<mark>g</mark>es the ball such that his first step is wron<mark>g</mark> (in for a lon<mark>g</mark> fly or back for a short fly), the turn-around time sharply reduces his ran<mark>g</mark>e and he will a<mark>g</mark>ain miss catchable balls. To help his jud<mark>g</mark>ment, the experienced outfielder listens to the sound of the wooden bat hittin<mark>g</mark> the ball. If he hears a 'crack' he runs out, if he hears a 'clunk' he runs in."[73]

When a catcher calls for the pitcher to throw one type of pitch (e.<mark>g</mark>., a fastball) but the pitcher throws another (e.<mark>g</mark>., a curveball), the catcher has been crossed up. This may lead to a passed ball, allowin<mark>g</mark> a runner on base to advance. "Barrett's passed ball allowed the last of three runs to score in the fifth as the Reds increased their lead to 7–2. Williams' pitch crossed him up. 'I was lookin<mark>g</mark> for a sinker and it cut away from me', Barrett said. 'I had a play at the plate, but my shin <mark>g</mark>uard stuck in the <mark>g</mark>rass. It was a frustratin<mark>g</mark> day.'"[75]
When a batter has been set up to expect a certain type of pitch but instead receives a different one, he may be crossed up, perhaps leadin<mark>g</mark> to a weakly hit ball or a swin<mark>g</mark> and a miss.

When a pitcher throws the ball toward the inside part of the plate, he may be tryin<mark>g</mark> to "crowd the hitter" by makin<mark>g</mark> it difficult for him to extend his arms and <mark>g</mark>et a full swin<mark>g</mark> at the pitch.

When a batter sets his stance extremely close to the plate, sometimes coverin<mark>g</mark> up part of the strike zone. This an<mark>g</mark>ers pitchers and, if done repeatedly, can lead to a brush-back pitch or even a beanball bein<mark>g</mark> thrown at the batter to clear the plate. "I am fully aware that when you crowd the plate, you're <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> to <mark>g</mark>et a hi<mark>g</mark>h heater."[76]

A batter who hits a ball extremely hard and far mi<mark>g</mark>ht be said to crush the ball, as if he had destroyed the baseball or at least chan<mark>g</mark>ed its shape. Related expressions are crunched the ball or mashed the ball. Indeed, a slu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er is sometimes described as a masher. Illustration: "Thou<mark>g</mark>h the 25-year-old has impressed with two homers in five <mark>g</mark>ames, he's more of a pure hitter than a masher."
Other types of baseball destruction include knockin<mark>g</mark> the stuffin<mark>g</mark> out of the ball and knockin<mark>g</mark> the horsehide [cover] off the ball.

When a ball is hit off the end of the bat, the batter may be said to have "cued the ball" (as if he hit it with a pool cue). "Kendrick took third on a broken-bat <mark>g</mark>round-out and scored on a cued <mark>g</mark>rounder to first base by Ryan Shealy ..."[77]

When a batter reduces the amplitude of his swin<mark>g</mark>, either by chokin<mark>g</mark> up on the bat or just by startin<mark>g</mark> his swin<mark>g</mark> less far behind his head, he "cuts down on his swin<mark>g</mark>", thereby helpin<mark>g</mark> him to <mark>g</mark>et his bat around faster.

When a ball is hit in the <mark>g</mark>ap between outfielders, a fielder often has to make a choice whether to run toward the fence to catch or retrieve the ball or to run toward the ball and try to field it before it <mark>g</mark>ets by him and reaches the fence. In the latter case, he's said to "cut the ball off" because he's tryin<mark>g</mark> to shorten the path of the ball. "When Granderson drifted towards left-center field on Carlos Peña's fifth-innin<mark>g</mark> line drive, he wasn't headin<mark>g</mark> that direction to make a catch. He was preparin<mark>g</mark> to field it on the bounce. 'I was actually <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> into position to cut the ball off', Granderson said after the Ti<mark>g</mark>ers' 11–7 loss to the Rays Monday afternoon.

A defensive tactic where a fielder moves into a position between the outfielder who has fielded the batted ball and the base where a play can be made. This fielder is said to "cut off" the throw or to be the "cut-off man". This tactic increases accuracy over lon<mark>g</mark> distances and shortens the time required to <mark>g</mark>et a ball to a specific place. It also <mark>g</mark>ives the cut-off man the choice of puttin<mark>g</mark> out a trailin<mark>g</mark> runner tryin<mark>g</mark> to advance on the throw if he thinks it impossible to make the play at home. Missin<mark>g</mark> the cut-off (man) is considered a mistake by an outfielder (thou<mark>g</mark>h not scored as an error) because it may allow a runner to advance or to score.

A pull hitter is a batter who <mark>g</mark>enerally hits the ball to the same side as which he bats. That is, for a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed batter, who bats from the left side of the plate, will hit the ball to left field. Hitters are often referred to as dead pull if they rarely do anythin<mark>g</mark> other than pull the ball. A contemporary example of a dead pull hitter is Jason Giambi.

A sabermetric concept: the rate at which balls put into play are converted into outs by a team's defense.[82] An analo<mark>g</mark>ous concept is used in the analysis of other team sports, includin<mark>g</mark> basketball and football. It is fi<mark>g</mark>ured this way in baseball: 1-(((H+ROE)-HR)/(PA-(SO+HBP+HR))) where H=Hits allowed, ROE=opposin<mark>g</mark> team's reached base on error, HR=home runs allowed, PA=opposin<mark>g</mark> team's number of plate appearances, SO=team's pitchin<mark>g</mark> strikeouts, and HBP=pitcher's hit-by-pitch.

divin<mark>g</mark> over the plate
When a batter tends to lean in toward the plate so he can more easily hit a ball that is on the outside of the strike zone, he is said to be "divin<mark>g</mark> over the plate" or "divin<mark>g</mark> for the pitch". To protect the strike zone, a pitcher may respond to this by pitchin<mark>g</mark> the ball inside, perhaps with a "purpose pitch". "Now Glavine has an equalizer with his cutter. He can bore it into the hands of ri<mark>g</mark>hthanders to keep them from divin<mark>g</mark> over the plate with impunity at his sinker and chan<mark>g</mark>eup."[84]

doctorin<mark>g</mark> the ball
Applyin<mark>g</mark> a forei<mark>g</mark>n substance to the ball or otherwise alterin<mark>g</mark> it in order to put an unnatural spin on a pitch. Examples: By applyin<mark>g</mark> Vaseline or saliva (a spitball), or scuffin<mark>g</mark> with sandpaper, emery board (an emery ball), or by rubbin<mark>g</mark> vi<mark>g</mark>orously to create a shiny area of the ball (a shineball). All of these became ille<mark>g</mark>al be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> in the 1920 season, helpin<mark>g</mark> to end the dead-ball era. (Official Rules of Baseball, Rule 8.02(a).) In practice, there are ambi<mark>g</mark>uities about what kinds of thin<mark>g</mark>s a pitcher can le<mark>g</mark>ally do.[85]

A slan<mark>g</mark> term for the pitcher hittin<mark>g</mark> the batter with a pitched ball (knockdown pitch), either intentionally or accidentally. If a player "shows up" a pitcher (takin<mark>g</mark> a lon<mark>g</mark> time to circle the bases or havin<mark>g</mark> an excessive celebration after a home run), if an important player on a team is struck by a pitch, or a player violates of one of baseballs unwritten rules, the offendin<mark>g</mark> player can expect to <mark>g</mark>et "dotted" the next time he is at bat as a form of intimidation or correction of the perceived offense. Another of the "unwritten rules" is the "dottin<mark>g</mark>" done by the pitcher should be below chest level on the batter to minimize risk of injury as a hi<mark>g</mark>her pitch risks injuries to the hands or even the head. Pitchin<mark>g</mark> hi<mark>g</mark>her is known as "head huntin<mark>g</mark>" or "buzzin<mark>g</mark> the tower", and puts the pitcher at risk of actual violence by the other team.

The double switch is a type of player substitution that allows a mana<mark>g</mark>er to make a pitchin<mark>g</mark> substitution and defensive (fieldin<mark>g</mark>) substitution while at the same time improvin<mark>g</mark> the team's offensive (battin<mark>g</mark>) lineup. This is most effectively used when a pitcher needs to be replaced while his team is on defense, and his turn to bat is comin<mark>g</mark> up in his team's next offensive try. Rather than replace the pitcher with another pitcher, a position player (one who recently batted in his team's last offensive try) is replaced with a new pitcher, and the out<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> pitcher is replaced by a player able to play the position of the out<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> position player. The two subs then trade to their natural defensive roles but keep the battin<mark>g</mark> order positions of those they replaced so that when the team next comes up to bat, it is the newly subbed position player who hits durin<mark>g</mark> the turn of the vacated pitcher, and the new pitcher does not have to hit until the out<mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> position player's turn comes a<mark>g</mark>ain. The double switch is primarily used by lea<mark>g</mark>ues that do not use desi<mark>g</mark>nated hitters, such as Japan's Central Lea<mark>g</mark>ue, or the National Lea<mark>g</mark>ue prior to 2022.

When a runner becomes the second out in a double play, he may be said to have been doubled up (or doubled off). This could be a batter who has hit into a double play or a runner who is cau<mark>g</mark>ht off base when a fielder catches a ball and throws behind the runner to a fielder who touches the base to complete a double play (hence "doublin<mark>g</mark> up" the runner).
A team that wins a doubleheader may be described as havin<mark>g</mark> doubled up their opponent: "Royals double up Blue Jays".[86] Also refers to winnin<mark>g</mark> by exactly double the amount of runs of the opponent, such as an 8–4 or 6–3 score.

A bunt in which a left-handed hitter lays down a bunt out of the reach of the pitcher and toward the ri<mark>g</mark>ht side of the infield, in hopes that he will safely reach first base. Often such a bunt has an element of surprise to take advanta<mark>g</mark>e of the batter's speed and the fact that the first baseman and second baseman are playin<mark>g</mark> their positions back. The batter may even take a stride toward first base as he bunts the ball, thereby appearin<mark>g</mark> to dra<mark>g</mark> the ball with him as he runs toward first base.

A batter who <mark>g</mark>ets called balls is sometimes said to have "drawn a ball" or "drawn a walk". "After a brief pause to put specially marked baseballs in play, Bonds drew ball one and ball two – with boos rainin<mark>g</mark> down on VandenHurk - before a called first strike. Then, the 96 mph fastball was <mark>g</mark>one – a drive estimated at 420 feet."[88]

When the outfield plays closer to the infield to prevent fly balls from droppin<mark>g</mark> between them and the infielders, they are said to be "drawn in". This typically happens when the <mark>g</mark>ame is close in the final innin<mark>g</mark>, and with less than two outs, and the defensive team wants to prevent the offense from <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> base hits that mi<mark>g</mark>ht score the winnin<mark>g</mark> run (while concedin<mark>g</mark> that a lon<mark>g</mark> fly ball mi<mark>g</mark>ht score a run even if the ball is cau<mark>g</mark>ht in the outfield).
The infield may also be drawn in if there is a runner on third base with less than two outs, so that the infielders may field a <mark>g</mark>round ball and attempt to throw out the runner at the plate.
A sin<mark>g</mark>le infielder, typically the third baseman or the first baseman may also play "in" when it's anticipated that a batter may attempt to make a sacrifice bunt.

A dropped third strike occurs when the catcher fails to cleanly catch a pitch which is a third strike (either because the batter swin<mark>g</mark>s and misses it or because the umpire calls it). The pitch is considered not cleanly cau<mark>g</mark>ht if the ball touches the dirt before bein<mark>g</mark> cau<mark>g</mark>ht, or if the ball is dropped after bein<mark>g</mark> cau<mark>g</mark>ht. On a dropped third strike, the strike is called (and a pitcher <mark>g</mark>ets credited with a strike-out), but the umpire indicates verbally that the ball was not cau<mark>g</mark>ht, and does not call the batter out. If first base is not occupied at the time (or, with two outs, even with first base occupied), the batter can then attempt to reach first base prior to bein<mark>g</mark> ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed or thrown out. Given this rule, it is possible for a pitcher to record more than three strike-outs in an innin<mark>g</mark>.

The home team's du<mark>g</mark>out at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 2017
The du<mark>g</mark>out is where a team's bench is located. With the exception of relief pitchers in the bullpen, active players who are not on the field watch the play from the du<mark>g</mark>out. A du<mark>g</mark>out is the area bein<mark>g</mark> sli<mark>g</mark>htly depressed below field level, as is common in professional baseball. There is typically a boundary, often painted yellow, definin<mark>g</mark> the ed<mark>g</mark>es of the du<mark>g</mark>out, to help the umpire make certain calls, such as whether an overthrown ball is considered to be "in the bench" or not. The rule book still uses the term bench, as there is no requirement that it be "du<mark>g</mark> out" or necessarily below field level. The ori<mark>g</mark>inal benches typically were at field level, with or without a little roof for shade. As ballpark desi<mark>g</mark>n pro<mark>g</mark>ressed, box seats were built closer to the field, lowerin<mark>g</mark> the hei<mark>g</mark>ht of the <mark>g</mark>randstand railin<mark>g</mark>, and compellin<mark>g</mark> the du<mark>g</mark>out approach to bench construction.

A player who bunts the ball may be said to dump a bunt. "Polanco dumped a bunt down the third base line." See also lay down. A ri<mark>g</mark>ht handed hitter dumps a bunt to third and pushes the bunt to first. A left handed hitter dra<mark>g</mark>s the ball to first and pushes the bunt to third

A pitch, often a brush-back, thrown so far inside that the batter drops to the <mark>g</mark>round ("hits the dust") to avoid it. Somewhat contradictorily, on the same play the pitcher may be said to have "dusted off" the batter.
dyin<mark>g</mark> quail

Any run for which the pitcher is held accountable (i.e., the run did not score as a result of a fieldin<mark>g</mark> error or a passed ball). Primarily used to calculate the earned run avera<mark>g</mark>e. In determinin<mark>g</mark> earned runs, an error char<mark>g</mark>ed to a pitcher is treated exactly like an error char<mark>g</mark>ed to any other fielder. Some pitchers, notably Ed Lynch, referred to earned runs as "earnies".
earned run avera<mark>g</mark>e
Main article: Earned run avera<mark>g</mark>e
In baseball statistics, earned run avera<mark>g</mark>e is the mean of earned runs <mark>g</mark>iven up by a pitcher per nine innin<mark>g</mark>s pitched. It is determined by dividin<mark>g</mark> the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innin<mark>g</mark>s pitched and multiplyin<mark>g</mark> by nine. Runs resultin<mark>g</mark> from defensive errors are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations.

A reminder to the defensive team that when there are two outs only one more is needed to end the innin<mark>g</mark>, and therefore they should <mark>g</mark>et the easiest out possible. "Let's <mark>g</mark>o D, two away, <mark>g</mark>et the easy out." An easy out is also a weak-hittin<mark>g</mark> batter, usually at the bottom of the order.

The action of fieldin<mark>g</mark> a batted ball (usually cleanly or almost so) but holdin<mark>g</mark> on to it rather than attemptin<mark>g</mark> to make a throw to a base to retire a runner. This is usually done because the fielder believes there is little chance of retirin<mark>g</mark> the runner and that it would be preferable to allow the runner to reach one base unchallen<mark>g</mark>ed rather than risk committin<mark>g</mark> an error that mi<mark>g</mark>ht allow the runner to advance additional bases. The phrase is usually used only to describe the action of an infielder, catcher, or pitcher. "That slow roller didn't <mark>g</mark>et past a divin<mark>g</mark> Scutaro, but he decided to eat the ball rather than risk a throw to nip the quick-runnin<mark>g</mark> Gardner." Also commonly used in the past-tense. "The char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> third baseman Cabrera ate the ball after that <mark>g</mark>reat bunt from Juan Pierre."[citation needed]

An error is a fielder's misplay which allows a batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases when, in the jud<mark>g</mark>ment of the official scorer, that advance could have been prevented by ordinary effort. An error is also char<mark>g</mark>ed when a fielder fails to catch a foul fly ball that could have been cau<mark>g</mark>ht with ordinary effort. The term error can also refer to the play in which an error was committed. Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball so much, some misplays by them are called a "wild pitch" or a "passed ball", and are not counted as errors.

When a batter is able to hit a pitch that is at a comfortable distance from his body, he is said to have "extended his arms", which allows a full swin<mark>g</mark> and hittin<mark>g</mark> the ball harder. "J. D. Martinez has hit two homers in three career at-bats off Allen, who was tryin<mark>g</mark> to protect a 2–1 lead a<mark>g</mark>ainst the middle of Detroit's vaunted lineup. 'I was just overthrowin<mark>g</mark> it', Allen said. 'I just didn't make pitches when I had to. One pitch – J. D. Martinez <mark>g</mark>ot extended on a fastball and hit it very hard.'"[95]

The first time the Fall Classic extended in to November was in 2001.

When a fan or any person not associated with one of the teams alters play in pro<mark>g</mark>ress (in the jud<mark>g</mark>ment of an umpire), it is fan interference. The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or char<mark>g</mark>e any outs that, in his jud<mark>g</mark>ment, would have occurred without the interference. This is one of several types of interference calls in baseball.

In modern baseball the field mana<mark>g</mark>er is normally subordinate to the team's <mark>g</mark>eneral mana<mark>g</mark>er (or GM), who amon<mark>g</mark> other thin<mark>g</mark>s is responsible for personnel decisions, includin<mark>g</mark> hirin<mark>g</mark> and firin<mark>g</mark> the field mana<mark>g</mark>er. However, the term mana<mark>g</mark>er used without qualification almost always refers to the field mana<mark>g</mark>er.

A fielder's choice (FC) is the act of a fielder, upon fieldin<mark>g</mark> a batted ball, choosin<mark>g</mark> to try to putout a baserunner and allow the batter-runner to advance to first base. Despite reachin<mark>g</mark> first base safely after hittin<mark>g</mark> the ball, the batter is not credited with a hit but would be char<mark>g</mark>ed with an at-bat.

fi<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er filbert
An old-fashioned and more colorful way of sayin<mark>g</mark> "numbers nut", for a fan with a near-obsessive interest in the statistics or "fi<mark>g</mark>ures" of the <mark>g</mark>ame. The first true "fi<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er filbert" was probably Ernest Lani<mark>g</mark>an, who was the first historian of the Baseball Hall of Fame and prior to that was one of the first, if not the first, to publish an encyclopedia of baseball stats, in the 1920s. In the modern era, Bill James could be said to be the iconic "fi<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er filbert". He is also a foundin<mark>g</mark> father of the field of baseball research called sabermetrics.[citation needed]

A compliment for a pitcher, especially one who specializes in breakin<mark>g</mark> balls with a lot of movement. Also for a particularly impressive breakin<mark>g</mark> ball, especially one thrown for a third strike. Synonymous with "nasty". Bert Blyleven was an example of a pitcher with an absolutely filthy curveball.

The ri<mark>g</mark>ht field foul line at Ro<mark>g</mark>ers Centre
Two strai<mark>g</mark>ht lines drawn on the <mark>g</mark>round from home plate to the outfield fence to indicate the boundary between fair territory and foul territory. These are called either the left-field foul line and the ri<mark>g</mark>ht-field foul line, or the third-base foul line and first-base foul line, respectively. The foul poles on the outfield walls are vertical extensions of the foul lines.

These are called either the left-field foul line and the ri<mark>g</mark>ht-field foul line, or the third-base foul line and first-base foul line, respectively. The foul poles on the outfield walls are vertical extensions of the foul lines.
Despite their names, both the foul lines and the foul poles are in fair territory. Any fly ball that strikes the foul line (includin<mark>g</mark> the foul pole) beyond first or third base is a fair ball (and in the case of the foul pole, a home run).

Note that while the foul lines in baseball are in fair territory, just like the side- and end-lines of a tennis court, in basketball or American football the sidelines are considered out of bounds. In other words, hittin<mark>g</mark> the ball "on the line" is <mark>g</mark>ood for the offensive player in baseball and tennis, but steppin<mark>g</mark> on the line is bad for the offensive player in basketball and American football. The situation is sli<mark>g</mark>htly different in association football (soccer): the sideline and the <mark>g</mark>oal line are inbounds, and the ball is out of play when it has wholly crossed the side line (touch line) or the <mark>g</mark>oal line, whether on the <mark>g</mark>round or in the air.

A pole located on each foul line on the outfield fence or wall. The left-field foul pole and ri<mark>g</mark>ht-field foul pole are used by umpires to determine whether a batted ball is a home run or a foul ball. The foul pole is a vertical extension of the foul line. The term "foul pole" is actually a misnomer, because the "foul pole" (like the foul line) is in fair territory and a fly ball that hits the foul pole is considered to be a fair ball (and a home run).

A batted ball that is hit sharply and directly from the bat to the catcher's mitt and le<mark>g</mark>ally cau<mark>g</mark>ht by the catcher. It is not a foul tip, as most announcers and journalists mistakenly use the term, if the ball is not cau<mark>g</mark>ht by the catcher. In this case, it is simply a foul ball. It is also not considered a foul tip if it rebounds off somethin<mark>g</mark>, like the <mark>g</mark>round, catcher's mask, the batter, etc. after bein<mark>g</mark> struck by the bat but before touchin<mark>g</mark> the catcher's mitt. A foul tip is considered in play, not a foul ball, and also counts as a strike, includin<mark>g</mark> the third strike (and is also considered a strikeout for the pitcher). It is si<mark>g</mark>nalled by the umpire puttin<mark>g</mark> his ri<mark>g</mark>ht hand flat in the air and brushin<mark>g</mark> his left hand a<mark>g</mark>ainst it (imitatin<mark>g</mark> the ball <mark>g</mark>lancin<mark>g</mark> off the bat) and then usin<mark>g</mark> his standard strike call. If the out is not the third out then the ball is alive and in play (unlike on a foul) and runners are in jeopardy if they are tryin<mark>g</mark> to advance.

As a verb, framin<mark>g</mark> [a pitch] refers to the positionin<mark>g</mark> and/or movement of the catcher's mitt and body when he catches a pitch and the effect this has on the umpire callin<mark>g</mark> a pitch a strike. The boundaries of the strike zone are clearly defined in the rules; however, with many major-lea<mark>g</mark>ue pitches travelin<mark>g</mark> well in excess of 90 mph (140 km/h), or with "movin<mark>g</mark>" pitches such as the curveball and the knuckleball, it is often difficult for an umpire to jud<mark>g</mark>e whether a ball went throu<mark>g</mark>h the strike zone based solely on watchin<mark>g</mark> the ball, particularly at the boundaries of the strike zone. Consequently, umpires sometimes unofficially use the catcher's position and/or movement to help jud<mark>g</mark>e whether a pitch is a strike. Framin<mark>g</mark> is a catcher's attempt to use this to his team's advanta<mark>g</mark>e. For example, on a pitch near the boundary of the strike zone, a catcher mi<mark>g</mark>ht move his mitt a short, subtle distance toward the strike zone within a split second after catchin<mark>g</mark> the ball, with the hope that the umpire will call a strike even if it did not <mark>g</mark>o throu<mark>g</mark>h the strike zone. Conversely, a pitch near the top of the strike zone mi<mark>g</mark>ht be called a ball if the catcher has to rise from his crouched position to catch it, even if it did <mark>g</mark>o throu<mark>g</mark>h the defined strike zone. Sabermetricians have developed metrics for how well catchers perform in framin<mark>g</mark> pitches.[108]

<mark>g</mark>love
Main article: Baseball <mark>g</mark>love
A baseball <mark>g</mark>love or mitt is a lar<mark>g</mark>e padded leather <mark>g</mark>love that players on the defensive team wear to assist them in catchin<mark>g</mark> and fieldin<mark>g</mark>. Different positions require different shapes and sizes of <mark>g</mark>loves. The term "mitt" is officially reserved to describe the catcher's mitt and the first-baseman's mitt. By rule, fielders other than the first-baseman and the catcher can wear only conventional <mark>g</mark>loves (with individual fin<mark>g</mark>er slots), not mitts. There is no rule requirin<mark>g</mark> fielders to wear a <mark>g</mark>love or mitt, but the nature of the <mark>g</mark>ame makes it necessary. A fielder may have to catch a ball bare-handed, if he loses his <mark>g</mark>love in pursuit of a ball or finds himself at the wron<mark>g</mark> an<mark>g</mark>le to use it.
Most batters nowadays wear leather battin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>loves to improve their <mark>g</mark>rip and provide a small amount of paddin<mark>g</mark>. Base-stealin<mark>g</mark> artists, especially those who practice the head-first hands-first slide, wear specialized slidin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>loves.
Players <mark>g</mark>enerally keep battin<mark>g</mark> and slidin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>loves in their pants pockets when not in use, and their fieldin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>loves in the du<mark>g</mark>out. At one time, players would leave their fieldin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>loves on the field; later they carried them in their pants pockets. This illustrates (1) how much lar<mark>g</mark>er and ba<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ier uniforms were and (2) how much smaller the <mark>g</mark>loves were. The ada<mark>g</mark>e "two hands while you're learnin<mark>g</mark>" was a necessity in the early years, when <mark>g</mark>loves simply absorbed shock. The <mark>g</mark>love has since evolved into a much more effective "trap", and one-hand catches are now the norm.
Jokes used in movies and cartoons notwithstandin<mark>g</mark>, the rules forbid throwin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>love to "catch", slow down, or even touch a batted ball. When the umpire calls it, the batter is awarded an automatic triple (meanin<mark>g</mark> all runners ahead of him are allowed to score freely); it is also a live ball, and the batter-runner can try for home. Similarly, it is a<mark>g</mark>ainst the rules to use one's cap as a <mark>g</mark>love, as "All the Way Mae" (Madonna) did in A Lea<mark>g</mark>ue of Their Own. Note that it is only a<mark>g</mark>ainst the rules to actually touch the ball with a thrown <mark>g</mark>love or other equipment; there is no penalty if the ball is not touched.
A player who is very skilled at defense is said to have a <mark>g</mark>ood <mark>g</mark>love.
A player who is very skilled at defense is said to have a <mark>g</mark>ood <mark>g</mark>love.
An abbreviation for <mark>g</mark>eneral mana<mark>g</mark>er.
<mark>g</mark>o-ahead run
The run which puts a team which was behind or tied into the lead. Used particularly with runners on base (e.<mark>g</mark>., "The Phillies have Jimmy Rollins and Shane Victorino on base down 4–2; Victorino represents the tyin<mark>g</mark> run and Chase Utley is the <mark>g</mark>o-ahead run at the plate.").
<mark>g</mark>o deep
<mark>g</mark>o deep
A startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher who pitches past the 6th innin<mark>g</mark> is said to "<mark>g</mark>o deep into the <mark>g</mark>ame". "A<mark>g</mark>ainst the White Sox on Thursday, Morrow's command wasn't there. He walked six batters in 5+2⁄3 innin<mark>g</mark>s, and despite comin<mark>g</mark> one out shy of recordin<mark>g</mark> a quality start, he didn't prove yet he's able to pitch deep into <mark>g</mark>ames."[119]
<mark>g</mark>o down in order
When the defendin<mark>g</mark> team allows no opponent on base in a half-innin<mark>g</mark>, thereby retirin<mark>g</mark> the side facin<mark>g</mark> the minimum three batters, the battin<mark>g</mark> team is said to have <mark>g</mark>one down in order, the defendin<mark>g</mark> team is said to have retired it in order.
<mark>g</mark>o quietly
When a team fails to mount a stron<mark>g</mark> offense, such as <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> 1–2–3 in an innin<mark>g</mark>, it may be said to have "<mark>g</mark>one quietly". "Outside of a walk to Mantle after Tresh's clout and a ninth-innin<mark>g</mark> sin<mark>g</mark>le by Pepitone, the Yankees went quietly the rest of the way."[120]
A player who retires without a lot of fanfare or complainin<mark>g</mark> may be said to "<mark>g</mark>o quietly".

<mark>g</mark>olden sombrero
Main article: <mark>g</mark>olden sombrero
One who strikes out four times in one <mark>g</mark>ame is said to have <mark>g</mark>otten a "<mark>g</mark>olden sombrero". Three strike outs is called the "hat trick", while the rare five strike outs is called the "platinum sombrero." Only ei<mark>g</mark>ht times has a player struck out six times in a <mark>g</mark>ame; this is called the "horn" (named by Mike Flana<mark>g</mark>an after Sam Horn who did this in 1991), "double-platinum sombrero," or "titanium sombrero." If it ever happens, Flana<mark>g</mark>an said a seven-strikeout <mark>g</mark>ame shall be called "Horn-A-Plenty."
<mark>g</mark>olfing
Swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> at an obviously low pitch, particularly one in the dirt. Also used to describe actual contact with a pitch low in the zone.
<mark>g</mark>one
A home run. Announcer: "That ball is <mark>g</mark>one."
Conversely, a batter who has just been struck out, especially by a power pitcher, as in "He <mark>g</mark>one!"
An announcer may simply announce "one <mark>g</mark>one" or "two <mark>g</mark>one" to indicate how many outs have been made in the innin<mark>g</mark>; likewise "one away" and "two away".
<mark>g</mark>ood eye
A hitter who has excellent awareness of the strike zone, and is able to lay off pitches that are barely out of the strike zone, is said to have a "<mark>g</mark>ood eye", "Ortiz and Ramirez are a constant threat, whether it's swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the bats or takin<mark>g</mark> pitches", Cleveland third baseman Casey Blake said. "They have a couple of the best swin<mark>g</mark>s in the <mark>g</mark>ame and a couple of the best eyes in the <mark>g</mark>ame ..."[121]
<mark>g</mark>ood hit, no field
Said to have been the world's shortest scoutin<mark>g</mark> report, and often quoted in reference to slu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ers such as Dick Stuart and Dave Kin<mark>g</mark>man, who were notoriously poor fielders.
<mark>g</mark>ood piece of hitting
A situation where a batter puts the ball in play in a way that maximizes the result for his team. "Good pieces of hittin<mark>g</mark>" tend to result in runs scorin<mark>g</mark> and drainin<mark>g</mark> several pitches out of an opposin<mark>g</mark> pitcher, especially in situations where the pitcher's team was lookin<mark>g</mark> for a decent amount of len<mark>g</mark>th.

<mark>g</mark>opher ball
A <mark>g</mark>opher ball (or <mark>g</mark>opher pitch) is a pitch that leads to a home run, one the batter will "<mark>g</mark>o for". Illustration from an on-line chat: "He was always that <mark>g</mark>uy who'd <mark>g</mark>o in and throw the <mark>g</mark>opher pitch in the first innin<mark>g</mark> and he'd be two down." A <mark>g</mark>ame in which several home runs are hit by both teams may also be described as "<mark>g</mark>opher ball".
<mark>g</mark>ot a piece of it
When a batter hits a foul ball or foul tip, perhaps survivin<mark>g</mark> a two strike count and remainin<mark>g</mark> at bat, a broadcaster may say "He <mark>g</mark>ot a piece of it."
<mark>g</mark>ot him
Short for "<mark>g</mark>ot him out".
<mark>g</mark>ot to him early
When a team's batters <mark>g</mark>ets several hits and runs off of the opposin<mark>g</mark> startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher in early innin<mark>g</mark>s the batters are said to "<mark>g</mark>et to him early".

<mark>g</mark>ot under the ball
When a hitter swin<mark>g</mark>s sli<mark>g</mark>htly under the center of the pitched ball, thereby leadin<mark>g</mark> to a hi<mark>g</mark>h fly ball out instead of a home run, he's said to "<mark>g</mark>et under the ball".

<mark>g</mark>randstand play
Showin<mark>g</mark> off for the fans in the <mark>g</mark>randstands. Also called <mark>g</mark>randstandin<mark>g</mark>. Not only players, but mana<mark>g</mark>ers, owners, and politicians often play to the crowd to raise their public ima<mark>g</mark>e. An example: "Tellem wei<mark>g</mark>hed in with a thou<mark>g</mark>htful back-pa<mark>g</mark>e article in this Sunday's New York Times re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> the recent Con<mark>g</mark>ressional and mainstream media <mark>g</mark>randstandin<mark>g</mark> over steroids."[122]

<mark>g</mark>reat seats
A sarcastic term for seats hi<mark>g</mark>h in the bleachers, a lon<mark>g</mark> way from the playin<mark>g</mark> field. The phrase was popularized by Bob Uecker in a series of TV commercials.
<mark>g</mark>reen li<mark>g</mark>ht
Permission from the mana<mark>g</mark>er for a batter or runner to be a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressive. Examples include permission for the batter to swin<mark>g</mark> away on a 3–0 count or for a runner to steal a base. An example: "Instead of the bunt si<mark>g</mark>n, Ti<mark>g</mark>ers mana<mark>g</mark>er Jim Leyland <mark>g</mark>ave Rodrí<mark>g</mark>uez the <mark>g</mark>reen li<mark>g</mark>ht and he hit a three-run homer off Riske to <mark>g</mark>ive the Ti<mark>g</mark>ers a 3–2 win over Kansas City on Sunday."[124]
<mark>g</mark>reen monster
<mark>g</mark>reen monster
The Green Monster is a popular nickname for the 37.2 feet (11.3 m) hi<mark>g</mark>h left field wall at Fenway Park, home to the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The wall is 310 feet (94.5 m) from home plate and is a popular tar<mark>g</mark>et for ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed hitters. The seats on top of the Monster, installed for the 2003 season, are amon<mark>g</mark> the most coveted seats at Fenway.
The Red Sox have sprin<mark>g</mark> trainin<mark>g</mark> at JetBlue Park at Fenway South (informally, JetBlue Park) in Fort Myers, Florida. JetBlue is an exact copy of Fenway, includin<mark>g</mark> a full-sized Green Monster.

<mark>g</mark>roove a pitch
When a pitcher throws a pitch down the middle of the plate ("the <mark>g</mark>roove"). The result may be predictable. An example: "But in the third, with two out and a man at second and the Cards ahead 2–1, Verlander <mark>g</mark>rooved a pitch that Pujols clobbered for a home run."[125]
<mark>g</mark>round ball
<mark>g</mark>round ball
A hit that bounces in the infield. Also <mark>g</mark>rounder. A bunt is not considered a <mark>g</mark>round ball.
<mark>g</mark>round ball with eyes
A <mark>g</mark>round ball that barely <mark>g</mark>ets between two infielders for a base hit, seemin<mark>g</mark> to "see" the only spot where it would be unfieldable. Also seein<mark>g</mark>-eye sin<mark>g</mark>le.
<mark>g</mark>round ball pitcher
A pitcher who tends to induce more <mark>g</mark>round balls than fly balls. Often a mana<mark>g</mark>er will brin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>round ball pitcher in as a relief pitcher when there are men on base and less than two outs, hopin<mark>g</mark> the next batter hits a <mark>g</mark>rounder into a double play.
<mark>g</mark>round-rule double
Under standard <mark>g</mark>round rules, there are conditions under which a batter is awarded second base automatically. If a ball hit in fair territory bounces over a wall or fence (or <mark>g</mark>ets cau<mark>g</mark>ht in the ivy at Wri<mark>g</mark>ley Field) without bein<mark>g</mark> touched by a fielder, it will likely be declared a double. If a ball hit into fair territory is touched by a fan, the batter is awarded an extra base.
<mark>g</mark>round rules
<mark>g</mark>round rules
Rules specific to a particular ballpark (or <mark>g</mark>rounds) due to unique features of the park and where the standard baseball rules may be inadequate.[126]
<mark>g</mark>uess hitter
A hitter who primarily <mark>g</mark>uesses what type of pitch is comin<mark>g</mark> and where it will be located as their approach to hittin<mark>g</mark> rather than just lookin<mark>g</mark> for a fastball and then reactin<mark>g</mark> to off speed pitches.
<mark>g</mark>un
A stron<mark>g</mark> arm. Also, a cannon.
To throw hard. Announcer (followin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>rounder and throw to first): "Guillen <mark>g</mark>uns and <mark>g</mark>ets him."
<mark>g</mark>un down
To throw out a runner. "Valentin was erased when he tried to steal second, thou<mark>g</mark>h, and Posada <mark>g</mark>unned him down."[127]
<mark>g</mark>yroball
<mark>g</mark>yroball
A type of curveball with a severe break. Boston Red Sox pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka is said to throw a <mark>g</mark>yroball. It was desi<mark>g</mark>ned by a couple of Japanese scientists to reduce arm fati<mark>g</mark>ue in pitchers. The result was a way to throw the ball with an extreme break. Whether such a special pitch really exists remains the subject of <mark>g</mark>reat controversy amon<mark>g</mark> experts of various pedi<mark>g</mark>rees.[128]

When a pitcher uses a particular type of pitch so much that he becomes less effective, he's sometimes said to be "happy" with the pitch – fastball happy or curveball happy, for example. "This article is a response, in part, to a Boston Globe sports rumor assertin<mark>g</mark> that Josh Beckett has become 'Curveball Happy' and has chan<mark>g</mark>ed his release point."[133]

When a player breaks their bat after hittin<mark>g</mark> the pitch, and the main portion of the bat (the barrel) lands within the infield, the broken portion can splinter into many pieces. (If the barrel lands either in foul territory or outside the established infield, the event is not a head of lettuce.) The term pays homa<mark>g</mark>e to other food-related baseball terms such as "can of corn", "hi<mark>g</mark>h cheese", "in a pickle", etc. The ori<mark>g</mark>inal use of the term dates to 2006 when Joshua Githens first noted the likeness to strikin<mark>g</mark> a head of lettuce with the bat. "That bat exploded like a head of lettuce!"

(There is no rule a<mark>g</mark>ainst such deception except that once the pitcher toes or stands astride the rubber, he must have the ball in his possession or else a balk will be called.)

He did it by settin<mark>g</mark> up a video camera at a battin<mark>g</mark> ca<mark>g</mark>e near his home in Irvine, California, tapin<mark>g</mark> swin<mark>g</mark> after swin<mark>g</mark>, and comparin<mark>g</mark> it with video from his days with the Los An<mark>g</mark>eles Dod<mark>g</mark>ers."[140]

A baseball park in which hitters tend to perform better than avera<mark>g</mark>e. This may be a result of several factors, includin<mark>g</mark> the dimensions of the park (distance to the outfield fences, size of foul territory behind the plate and down the lines), prevailin<mark>g</mark> winds, temperature and relative humidity, and altitude. Whether a park is a hitter's park or a pitcher's park (in which hitters perform worse than avera<mark>g</mark>e) is determined statistically by measurin<mark>g</mark> Park Factors, which involves comparin<mark>g</mark> how well hitters perform in a <mark>g</mark>iven park compared with how they perform in all other parks. This measure is re<mark>g</mark>ularly reported and updated for Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball parks by ESPN.com.[141] Baseball Reference [142] and other baseball research or<mark>g</mark>anizations also report park factors for major lea<mark>g</mark>ue parks. Baseball Prospectus [143] and other baseball researchers calculate park factors for minor lea<mark>g</mark>ue parks to help in adjustin<mark>g</mark> the statistics of baseball prospects.
Whether a park is a hitter's park or pitcher's park may chan<mark>g</mark>e from day to day. For example, when the wind is blowin<mark>g</mark> "out" at Wri<mark>g</mark>ley Field, it is typically rendered a "hitter's park", and a double-di<mark>g</mark>it score for one or both teams is not unusual.

A hold (abbreviated as H) is awarded to a relief pitcher if he enters in a save situation, records at least one out, and leaves the <mark>g</mark>ame without havin<mark>g</mark> relinquished that lead. To receive a hold, the pitcher must not finish the <mark>g</mark>ame (thus becomin<mark>g</mark> the closin<mark>g</mark> pitcher) or be the winnin<mark>g</mark> pitcher.
Unlike saves, more than one pitcher can earn a hold in a <mark>g</mark>ame. It is also not necessary for the pitcher's team to win the <mark>g</mark>ame in order to achieve a hold; they merely have to be in the lead at the time the pitcher exits.
The hold was invented in 1986 to <mark>g</mark>ive credit to non-closer relief pitchers. Holds are most often accredited to setup pitchers, as they usually pitch between the starter and the closer. Holds are not an official Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball statistic, but are reco<mark>g</mark>nized by the MLB in its rules.

When a player for the home team <mark>g</mark>ets a favorable or <mark>g</mark>enerous call from the official scorer, the players may refer to the scorer's call as "home cookin<mark>g</mark>". For example, the scorer may credit a batter for a base hit on a batted ball that a fielder bobbled briefly and then failed to make a putout.
"Home cookin<mark>g</mark>" is sometimes used synonymously with home field advanta<mark>g</mark>e. The reference may be to the home team havin<mark>g</mark> the advanta<mark>g</mark>e of livin<mark>g</mark> at home, not just to bein<mark>g</mark> able to play in its own stadium.

Main article: Home advanta<mark>g</mark>e
Teams playin<mark>g</mark> home <mark>g</mark>ames have a small advanta<mark>g</mark>e over visitin<mark>g</mark> teams. In recent decades, home teams have tended to win about 53.5% of their <mark>g</mark>ames.[148] Because teams play the same number of <mark>g</mark>ames at home as they do away durin<mark>g</mark> the re<mark>g</mark>ular season, this advanta<mark>g</mark>e tends to even out. In play-off series, however, teams hope to <mark>g</mark>ain from home-field advanta<mark>g</mark>e by havin<mark>g</mark> the first <mark>g</mark>ame of the series played in their home stadium.

For other uses, see home run derby (disambi<mark>g</mark>uation).
A battin<mark>g</mark> competition in which the object is to hit the most home runs.[149] The 1960 television series Home Run Derby featured such a competition.[150] The term can also be used to refer to a <mark>g</mark>ame durin<mark>g</mark> which many home runs are hit.[151] The term was first used in the 1920s to refer to the race ("derby") between batters to lead their lea<mark>g</mark>ue in home runs for the season.[152]
Since 1985, Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball has hosted an annual Home Run Derby,[153] and the Chinese Professional Baseball Lea<mark>g</mark>ue (CPBL) has done so since 1992. At least one minor lea<mark>g</mark>ue, the Southern Lea<mark>g</mark>ue, has also held a home run derby.[154] In 2007, the Israel Baseball Lea<mark>g</mark>ue played seven-innin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>ames, and if the teams were tied at the end of the seventh innin<mark>g</mark> the tie was broken by use of a home run derby.[155] A number of amusement parks, entertainment centers and battin<mark>g</mark> ca<mark>g</mark>es offer a home run derby type competition.[149]

When a batter, realizin<mark>g</mark> the ball he just hit is about become a home run, slows from a run to a celebratory trot. "Well, I've been sayin<mark>g</mark> it all year, and it finally happened toni<mark>g</mark>ht: David Ortiz became the first player in the 2010 season to take more than 30-seconds to trot around the bases after a home run. With four of the top five slowest home run trots of the year already - all four of which were clocked in at 28.95 seconds or slower - it seemed inevitable that he would be the first to break the half-minute barrier."[156]
Sometimes a player mistakenly slows down, however, when the wind or a superb play by an outfielder, turns a home run into a double or sin<mark>g</mark>le off the outfield wall, or to a lon<mark>g</mark> out, or to another odd outcome, as the followin<mark>g</mark> case illustrates:

When a mana<mark>g</mark>er leaves the du<mark>g</mark>out with the obvious intention of replacin<mark>g</mark> the pitcher with a reliever, he may be said to be carryin<mark>g</mark> a hook.

Such a usa<mark>g</mark>e may have come from the lar<mark>g</mark>e hooks that were sometimes used in Vaudeville to yank unsuccessful acts off the sta<mark>g</mark>e if they were reluctant to leave on their own. When he was mana<mark>g</mark>er of the Cincinnati Reds, Sparky Anderson's heavy reliance on relief pitchin<mark>g</mark> earned him the nickname "Captain Hook", a reference both to the standard usa<mark>g</mark>e and to the Peter Pan villain.

The leather cover on the baseball (which is now usually made of cowhide, not horsehide). A slu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er may be said to "knock the horsehide off the ball". Horsehide was the cover of choice for decades, as it was less prone to stretchin<mark>g</mark> than cowhide. This was necessary in part because in the early days, they tried to play the entire <mark>g</mark>ame with a sin<mark>g</mark>le ball, or as few as possible. That became moot in the 1920s, but horsehide continued to be used until the 1980s or so, when horsehide became prohibitively expensive and cowhide was finally adopted as the standard cover for a baseball.

A human rain delay is a derisive term for a player who is very deliberate in his play, such as a pitcher who takes a lon<mark>g</mark> time between pitches or a batter who constantly steps out of the batter's box.

The umpire calls the batter out when (a) there are less than two outs in the innin<mark>g</mark>, and (b) the batter hits a fly ball that can be cau<mark>g</mark>ht with ordinary effort by an infielder in fair territory, and (c) there are runners on first and second or the bases are loaded.
The batter is automatically called out in this situation whether or not a fielder attempts to catch the fly ball, assumin<mark>g</mark> it stays fair. The rule states that the umpire is supposed to announce, "Infield fly, if fair." If the ball will be almost certainly fair, the umpire will likely yell, "Infield fly, batter's out!" or just "Batter's out!"
This rule is intended to prevent the fielder from intentionally droppin<mark>g</mark> the ball and <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> force outs on the runners on base. The rule is a little mystifyin<mark>g</mark> to casual fans of the <mark>g</mark>ame, but it has been a fundamental rule since 1895, alle<mark>g</mark>edly to prevent the notoriously tricky Baltimore Orioles from intentionally droppin<mark>g</mark> the ball.

Inherited runners or inherited baserunners are the runners on base when a relief pitcher enters the <mark>g</mark>ame. Since a previous pitcher has allowed these runners to reach base (or was simply pitchin<mark>g</mark> when the runners reached base, such as in the case of a fieldin<mark>g</mark> error), any inherited runners who score when the relief pitcher is pitchin<mark>g</mark> are char<mark>g</mark>ed to the previous pitcher's runs allowed and/or earned runs allowed total, dependin<mark>g</mark> on how each runner reached base. Modern box scores list how many runners each relief pitcher inherits (if any), and how many of those inherited runners the relief pitcher allows to score, called inherited runs allowed (IRA).

Main article: Inside Baseball (strate<mark>g</mark>y)
The inside baseball is an offensive strate<mark>g</mark>y that focuses on teamwork and <mark>g</mark>ood execution. It usually centers on tactics that keep the ball in the infield: walks, base hits, bunts, and stolen bases. This was the primary offensive strate<mark>g</mark>y durin<mark>g</mark> the Dead Ball Era. Inside baseball is also a common metaphor in American politics to describe back<mark>g</mark>round machinations. The equivalent modern term is small ball.

A <mark>g</mark>ame is in play when the umpire declares "play ball" at the be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> of the <mark>g</mark>ame or after a time-out.
Any batted ball is "in play" until either the play ends, the umpire calls the ball foul, or there is fan interference or some other event that leads to a dead ball. A ball hit into foul territory but in the air is in play (a fielder may attempt to catch it for an out and runners may attempt to advance after such a catch), but only before it hits the <mark>g</mark>round or the fence.

An acronym for Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Avera<mark>g</mark>e Innin<mark>g</mark> Muncher. A LAIM is <mark>g</mark>enerally a startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher who can provide around 200 innin<mark>g</mark>s over the course of a season with an ERA (Earned Run Avera<mark>g</mark>e) near the lea<mark>g</mark>ue avera<mark>g</mark>e.

If a batter decides not to swin<mark>g</mark> at a pitch, especially if he deliberately avoids swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> at certain types of pitches, he may be said to "lay off" a pitch. Pitchers tempt hitters to swin<mark>g</mark> at pitches they cannot hit; batters try to lay off such pitches.

Also "left-hand hitter". A batter who, paradoxically, bats from the ri<mark>g</mark>ht-side of the plate. Typically, an individual who is left-handed in most activities, includin<mark>g</mark> throwin<mark>g</mark> a baseball, stands in the ri<mark>g</mark>ht-hand batter's box, the one closest to first base.

A baserunner is said to have been left on base (abbreviated LOB) or stranded when the half-innin<mark>g</mark> ends and he has not scored or been put out. This includes a batter-runner who has hit into a fielder's choice, causin<mark>g</mark> another runner to be put out as the third out.[191] It also includes runners on base at the end of a <mark>g</mark>ame, as when the home team scores a winnin<mark>g</mark> run in the ninth or a subsequent innin<mark>g</mark>. Thus a batter who hits a sin<mark>g</mark>le in the home half of the tenth innin<mark>g</mark> in a tied <mark>g</mark>ame with the bases loaded drives in one run and leaves three on base (runners who were at first and second, and himself).
Team LOB totals are commonly reported in a baseball box score. It counts only those left standin<mark>g</mark> on the bases when the third out of each innin<mark>g</mark> occurs. Team LOB is used in "provin<mark>g</mark>" a box score. The number of a team's plate appearances is to equal the sum of that team's runs, that team's LOB, and the opposin<mark>g</mark> team's putouts. In other words, every batter who completes a plate appearance is accounted for as a run scored, putout, or LOB.
Individual LOB totals are sometimes reported in baseball box scores. This is a more recent statistic that is computed for each player who is at bat at least once in a <mark>g</mark>ame and is calculated on how many baserunners were "left on base" when the player was at-bat and caused an out, no matter how many outs there were at the time. Note that "at bat" does not include other plate appearances such as sacrifice bunts or flies made by the batter, third outs caused by pickoffs or cau<mark>g</mark>ht stealin<mark>g</mark>, or <mark>g</mark>ames ended with the winnin<mark>g</mark> run scorin<mark>g</mark> on a successful steal, etc. Two common misconceptions of the individual LOB are that the individual LOB is the number of times the player was left on base as a baserunner (this is a "runner's LOB" and is not usually recorded), or that the individual LOB applies only when the at-bat player caused the third out. Note that the total of the individual LOBs for all players on a team will usually exceed the team LOB.
A related statistic is "left on base in scorin<mark>g</mark> position", which includes only those LOB where the runner was occupyin<mark>g</mark> second or third base. Yet another related statistic is "left on base in scorin<mark>g</mark> position with less than two out". The intent of these statistics is to measure the tendency of a team or player to waste opportunities to score.
le<mark>g</mark> out
To run hard to <mark>g</mark>et safely on base or to advance a base: "Podsednik le<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out an infield hit, stole second and scored when Everett le<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out a double."[192]
letter hi<mark>g</mark>h
A letter-hi<mark>g</mark>h pitch is one that crosses the plate at the hei<mark>g</mark>ht of the letters on the batter's chest. Also see at the letters. Equivalent term: "chest hi<mark>g</mark>h". "Dietrich fouled off a couple of pitches before Porcello put him away with a letter-hi<mark>g</mark>h fastball at 94."[193]

A batter may be said to have "lined out" if the liner was cau<mark>g</mark>ht by a fielder.
Line drives can be dan<mark>g</mark>erous to baseball players and spectators.

To throw a pitch that keeps the hitter from makin<mark>g</mark> any effective swin<mark>g</mark>. For example, when a left-handed pitcher throws a roundhouse curve or an inside fastball to a left-handed hitter, the hitter may appear to freeze in place. "We had him 0-2.

lon<mark>g</mark> ball
A home run. A team is said to "win by the lon<mark>g</mark> ball" after a walk-off home run or the team hits several home runs to win. Headline: "Phillies Use the Lon<mark>g</mark>ball To Take Game 1 from the Dod<mark>g</mark>ers".[200]

lon<mark>g</mark> out
A ball that is hit deep into the outfield (and cau<mark>g</mark>ht) is a "lon<mark>g</mark> out".
lon<mark>g</mark> reliever
Main article: Lon<mark>g</mark> reliever
A type of relief pitcher. Lon<mark>g</mark> relievers enter early in a <mark>g</mark>ame (<mark>g</mark>enerally before the 5th innin<mark>g</mark>) when the startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitchin<mark>g</mark>, lack of endurance, rain delay, or injury.
lon<mark>g</mark> strike
A foul ball which finishes particularly close to bein<mark>g</mark> fair, often where a fair ball would have been a home run. So named as despite the <mark>g</mark>ood effort of the hitter, the result is a strike a<mark>g</mark>ainst him if the count before the pitch was less than two strikes.

A mildly dero<mark>g</mark>atory nickname for a left-handed specialist. An acronym for "Lefty One Out GuY", a left-handed pitcher who may be brou<mark>g</mark>ht into the <mark>g</mark>ame to pitch a<mark>g</mark>ainst just one or two left-handed batters to take extreme advanta<mark>g</mark>e of platoon effects. An example is Javier Lopez, who was a key component of the Giants' World Series winnin<mark>g</mark> bullpen in the 2010s. Startin<mark>g</mark> in 2020, MLB instituted a new rule that any pitcher who enters the <mark>g</mark>ame in the middle of an innin<mark>g</mark> must face at least three batters or finish the innin<mark>g</mark> before he can be replaced, unless he is injured. This rule intends to reduce the len<mark>g</mark>th of a <mark>g</mark>ame by limitin<mark>g</mark> pitchin<mark>g</mark> chan<mark>g</mark>es, but also reduces the benefit of a LOOGY on the roster, since most of the time he would also have to face a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed hitter, who is much more likely to <mark>g</mark>et a hit off him.

When there is a runner on first base, a pitcher who has already <mark>g</mark>one into the stretch may step off the rubber and either threaten a throw toward first base or just stare at the runner to encoura<mark>g</mark>e him to step back toward first. In either case he's said to "look the runner back" to first (rather than throwin<mark>g</mark> over to first in an effort to pick the runner off).
When there is a runner on second or third base (but not first) with fewer than two outs, an infielder fieldin<mark>g</mark> a sharp <mark>g</mark>round ball briefly stares at the runner to discoura<mark>g</mark>e him from tryin<mark>g</mark> to advance. The fielder then throws to first to force out the batter.

When a player does somethin<mark>g</mark> to catch the attention or make an impression on the other team, he may be said to "make a statement". Perhaps he makes a spectacular fieldin<mark>g</mark> play, hits a home run, slides hard into second base, or throws a brushback pitch. This phrase is also used in other sports when a team seeks to show up or to demonstrate its power a<mark>g</mark>ainst an opponent. "There were a lot of times where we could have <mark>g</mark>iven up, but no one <mark>g</mark>ave up. We made a statement here toni<mark>g</mark>ht".[206]

When an umpire makes a bad call on a pitch, he may implicitly acknowled<mark>g</mark>e it on a later pitch by makin<mark>g</mark> another bad call to "make up" for the first. For example, say an umpire mistakenly calls a strike on a pitch that is out of the strike zone; he may later call a ball on a pitch that is in the strike zone so the hitter <mark>g</mark>ets back what was initially taken away. Umpires typically, and understandably, deny there is any such thin<mark>g</mark> as a "make-up call".
make-up <mark>g</mark>ame
When a <mark>g</mark>ame is canceled because of a rainout or some other reason, a make-up <mark>g</mark>ame is usually scheduled later in the season. Late in the re<mark>g</mark>ular season if the outcome of that <mark>g</mark>ame would not affect which teams would reach the play-offs, then the <mark>g</mark>ame mi<mark>g</mark>ht not be made up.

A "mistake" is poor execution, as distin<mark>g</mark>uished from an error. It could be throwin<mark>g</mark> to the wron<mark>g</mark> base, missin<mark>g</mark> the cut-off, runnin<mark>g</mark> into an obvious out, or throwin<mark>g</mark> a pitch into the batter's "hot zone" instead of where the catcher set up for it.
There may be such a thin<mark>g</mark> as a mistake hitter (a mediocre hitter who occasionally <mark>g</mark>ets a pitch he can drive), but a "mistake pitcher" does not last lon<mark>g</mark> in the bi<mark>g</mark> lea<mark>g</mark>ues.

"Mitt" (derived from "mitten") can refer to any type of baseball <mark>g</mark>love, thou<mark>g</mark>h the term is officially reserved to describe the catcher's mitt and the first-baseman's mitt. Those mitts (like a mitten) have a slot for the thumb and a sin<mark>g</mark>le sheath coverin<mark>g</mark> all the fin<mark>g</mark>ers, rather than the individual fin<mark>g</mark>er slots that <mark>g</mark>loves have. By rule, mitts are allowed to be worn only by the catcher and the first baseman. See the entry on <mark>g</mark>love.

To be successful, most pitchers have to use a variety of pitches, and to mix them up tactically (not randomly) to keep hitters off balance. "Jackson was overwhelmin<mark>g</mark>. 'I was just tryin<mark>g</mark> to come out and be a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressive and mix my pitches up', he said. 'I've seen them in the past and I know what they can do. You have to mix it up to keep them honest'."[213]

An often misused term. It refers to Michael Lewis's 2002 book. "Moneyball player" most often refers to one who has a hi<mark>g</mark>h on-base percenta<mark>g</mark>e, and does not steal a lot of bases. However, the essence of the book is about runnin<mark>g</mark> an or<mark>g</mark>anization effectively by identifyin<mark>g</mark> inefficiencies and findin<mark>g</mark> undervalued assets in a <mark>g</mark>iven market. As an example, the so-called Moneyball teams have shifted their focus to defense and speed instead of OBP which is no lon<mark>g</mark>er undervalued. "Moneyball" is often seen as the antithesis of "smallball", where teams take chances on the basepaths in an attempt to "manufacture" runs. In more traditional baseball circles, evokin<mark>g</mark> Moneyball to describe a player or team can be a term of derision.

A home run that is hit very hi<mark>g</mark>h. When the Brooklyn Dod<mark>g</mark>ers relocated to Los An<mark>g</mark>eles and played in the L.A. Coliseum, Wally Moon took advanta<mark>g</mark>e of the short distance to the left-field fence—251 feet (77 m) from home plate down the left-field line, compared to 440 feet (130 m) to the ri<mark>g</mark>ht-field fence[215]—to hit hi<mark>g</mark>h home runs.[216][217] The ball had to be hit hi<mark>g</mark>h in order to clear the 42-foot-hi<mark>g</mark>h (13 m) fence. For comparison, Fenway Park's famous Green Monster is 37 feet (11 m) tall. Dod<mark>g</mark>ers broadcaster Jerry Do<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ett seems to have coined the phrase in 1959,[218] and the rest of the media picked it up.[216]

The pitcher's mound is a raised section in the middle of the diamond where the pitcher stands when throwin<mark>g</mark> the pitch. In Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball, a re<mark>g</mark>ulation mound is 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter, with the center 59 feet (18 m) from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and second base. The front ed<mark>g</mark>e of the pitcher's plate or rubber is 18 inches (46 cm) behind the center of the mound, makin<mark>g</mark> it 60 feet 6 inches (18.44 m) from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15.2 cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound be<mark>g</mark>ins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no hi<mark>g</mark>her than 10 inches (25 cm) above home plate. From 1903 throu<mark>g</mark>h 1968 this hei<mark>g</mark>ht limit was set at 15 inches, but was often sli<mark>g</mark>htly hi<mark>g</mark>her, especially for teams that emphasized pitchin<mark>g</mark>, such as the Los An<mark>g</mark>eles Dod<mark>g</mark>ers, who were reputed to have the hi<mark>g</mark>hest mound in the majors.

nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood play
Main article: Nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood play
An informal rule that used to apply to double plays. As lon<mark>g</mark> as the defensive player coverin<mark>g</mark> second base was in the "nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood" of second base when he cau<mark>g</mark>ht the ball and threw it on to first base, the runner would be called out. The rule was desi<mark>g</mark>ned to compensate for runners who slid into second too hard, makin<mark>g</mark> it dan<mark>g</mark>erous for the defensive player. In recent years, umpires have required the defensive player to have a foot actually on second base, not just in the nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood, and have penalized runners who slide toward the defensive players too a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressively, so nei<mark>g</mark>hborhood plays are rarely seen today.

Especially durin<mark>g</mark> finals and semifinals, each circle is typically painted with the correspondin<mark>g</mark> team lo<mark>g</mark>o. The location of the next batter's box is specifically defined in MLB rules, and the most common method to locate it was <mark>g</mark>ranted a patent.[227]
When a pitcher focuses on pitchin<mark>g</mark> just at the left or ri<mark>g</mark>ht ed<mark>g</mark>es of home plate rather than throwin<mark>g</mark> a pitch over the heart of the plate where a batter can <mark>g</mark>et the meat of the bat on the ball, he's said to nibble at the ed<mark>g</mark>es. Ti<mark>g</mark>ers mana<mark>g</mark>er Jim Leyland praised Scherzer for his a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressiveness a<mark>g</mark>ainst such a powerful lineup: "The one thin<mark>g</mark> you can't do a<mark>g</mark>ainst the Yankees is <mark>g</mark>et behind in the count. If you do, they'll just sit on pitches and hit a lot of them hard. Max went after them. He understood he couldn't nibble around the ed<mark>g</mark>es of the plate, and he did a heckuva job."[228]

A slider. Also used to mean an avera<mark>g</mark>e or possibly "han<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark>" slider. Hitters look at the spin on a ball when it is released by the pitcher, so the "dot" (circle which is created from the pitcher's rotation on the ball that the batter sees to identify a pitch as a slider out of the pitcher's hand) is said to be "nickel sized". Also, it could be used to mean a pitch with more lateral movement (closer to a slurve than to a slider) rather than velocity.

A <mark>g</mark>ame in which one team does not <mark>g</mark>et any hits, a rare feat for a pitcher, especially at the major lea<mark>g</mark>ue level. Also colloquially called a "no-no". If no batter reaches base safely by any means (walk, error, etc.) the pitcher is said to have pitched a perfect <mark>g</mark>ame, which is much rarer than a "normal" no-hitter.
It is a superstition that when a pitcher is workin<mark>g</mark> on a no-hitter (or perfect <mark>g</mark>ame), his teammates stay far away from him (sometimes even a whole bench len<mark>g</mark>th) and will not say anythin<mark>g</mark> to anyone about the no-hitter. Some play-by-play on-air announcers will also avoid mentionin<mark>g</mark> the no-hitter until either an opposin<mark>g</mark> batter <mark>g</mark>ets a hit or the no-hitter is completed; others however will mention one in pro<mark>g</mark>ress and are sometimes blamed for jinxin<mark>g</mark> no-hitters.[231]

Sometimes said by a play-by-play announcer when the bases are loaded, i.e., there is no open base. Usually means that intentionally walkin<mark>g</mark> and pitchin<mark>g</mark> around the batter are poor strate<mark>g</mark>ies for the fieldin<mark>g</mark> team, as a walk will score a run for the battin<mark>g</mark> team.

The official scorer is a person appointed by the lea<mark>g</mark>ue to record the events on the field and to send this official record to the lea<mark>g</mark>ue offices.[233] The official scorer never <mark>g</mark>oes on the field durin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>ame (but typically watches from the press box). The official scorer's jud<mark>g</mark>ments do not affect the pro<mark>g</mark>ress or outcome of the <mark>g</mark>ame but they do affect <mark>g</mark>ame and player statistics. For example, only umpires call balls and strikes, whether a batted ball is fair or foul, whether a hit is a home run, and whether runners are safe or out. But it is the official scorer who determines whether a pitch that <mark>g</mark>ot by the catcher is a wild pitch or a passed ball, and whether a batted ball is a hit or an error (or a combination of the two); likewise whose errors, put-outs and assists are whose.

See also Mendoza line. Players in the majors who spend too much time "on the interstate" will most likely be demoted to Triple-A.
When a pitcher appears to be tired or lost command of his pitches, he may be said to be "on the ropes" and about to be replaced by another pitcher. The term likely derives from the sport of boxin<mark>g</mark>, in which a fi<mark>g</mark>hter who is bein<mark>g</mark> beaten up or dominated by his opponent may lean a<mark>g</mark>ainst the ropes to keep from fallin<mark>g</mark> to the mat.

A defensive attempt to put out a baserunner attemptin<mark>g</mark> to reach more bases than the type of hit would typically allow, such as a runner on first attemptin<mark>g</mark> to advance to third on a sin<mark>g</mark>le.
Also refers to the successful advance of a baserunner while such a play is bein<mark>g</mark> attempted on his teammate. See also: fielder's choice.
A batter who safely reaches first base but is ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out attemptin<mark>g</mark> to reach a subsequent base on the same play is credited with a hit for the number of bases he safely reached, but is said to be out on the throw.
Example: With Abel on first base, Baker hits a base hit to center field. Abel easily reaches second and tries to advance to third, but the throw from the outfield is in time and he is ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out by the third baseman. Meanwhile, Baker has safely reached second base. Abel is out at third base on the throw. Baker has a sin<mark>g</mark>le and advanced to second on the throw. The next batter, Charlie, hits a double to the center field wall, allowin<mark>g</mark> Baker to score from second. Charlie safely rounds first and second base and attempts for third, but the throw from center field is in time and Charlie is ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed out at third base. Charlie is credited with an RBI double, but is out at third base on the throw.

A run that scores because of a passed ball is not scored as an earned run. Neither a passed ball nor a wild pitch is char<mark>g</mark>ed as an error. It is a separately kept statistic.

If after the pitcher from one team tries to bean or otherwise hit a batter, the opposin<mark>g</mark> pitcher retaliates by tryin<mark>g</mark> to hit a batter from the first pitcher's team, it's a "payback". Such retaliation often happens when it is one of a team's stars who is the initial tar<mark>g</mark>et; in such a case the opposin<mark>g</mark> pitcher is likely to tar<mark>g</mark>et the star player on the other team when he <mark>g</mark>ets his first opportunity. Umpires may issue a warnin<mark>g</mark> if they think a pitch is intentionally thrown at a batter, and if such an attempt happens a<mark>g</mark>ain by either team's pitcher, the pitcher is likely to be ejected from the <mark>g</mark>ame.

A park in which pitchers tend to perform better than they perform on avera<mark>g</mark>e in all other parks; inverse of hitter's park. See park factor.
When the wind is blowin<mark>g</mark> "in" at Wri<mark>g</mark>ley Field, it is typically rendered a "pitcher's park", and a low score for one or both teams is not unusual. Under those circumstances, no-hitters also become possible at a park many fans normally think of as a "hitter's park".
Because of its lar<mark>g</mark>e foul area (recently shrunk to add more seatin<mark>g</mark>), symmetrical outfield walls, and small "corners" near the foul poles, Dod<mark>g</mark>er Stadium is traditionally known as a pitcher's park, especially at ni<mark>g</mark>ht, when fly balls tend to die more quickly than they do durin<mark>g</mark> the day.

Any turn at bat is considered a plate appearance for computin<mark>g</mark> stats such as on-base percenta<mark>g</mark>e, and for determinin<mark>g</mark> whether a batter has enou<mark>g</mark>h of them (minimum 3.1 X number of scheduled <mark>g</mark>ames) to qualify for the battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e championship. Plate appearances consist of standard at-bats plus situations where there is no at-bat char<mark>g</mark>ed, such as a base on balls or a sacrifice. However, if the batter is standin<mark>g</mark> in the batter's box and the third out is made elsewhere (for example, by a cau<mark>g</mark>ht-stealin<mark>g</mark> or by an appeal play), then it does not count as an appearance, because that same batter will lead off the next innin<mark>g</mark>.

When two baseball clubs make a trade, part of the publicly announced deal may involve an unspecified "player to be named later" who is not one of the headline players in the deal. In some cases, the PTBNL is simply a financial payment equal to the annual salary of a base-level major lea<mark>g</mark>ue baseball player ($300,000 as of 2007).
players' mana<mark>g</mark>er
A mana<mark>g</mark>er who is close to his players and whom the players consider a peer and a friend. The knock on players' mana<mark>g</mark>ers is that they tend to not be disciplinarians and find it hard to make a tou<mark>g</mark>h decision in the team's best interest. Thus the term is not always complimentary, and many mana<mark>g</mark>ers find they must maintain some aloofness in order to be effective. Joe Torre is often referred to as a player's mana<mark>g</mark>er; his approach can be effective with mature players who take their responsibilities seriously. Casey Sten<mark>g</mark>el used to say the secret to mana<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> was "to keep the <mark>g</mark>uys who are neutral about you away from the <mark>g</mark>uys that hate your <mark>g</mark>uts."

A pop-up is a batted ball that is hit very hi<mark>g</mark>h and stays in the infield. Called a pop-foul when it falls or is cau<mark>g</mark>ht in foul territory. Example: "Rondini popped it foul out of play" implies that Rondini hit a pop-up or pop-foul that went into the stands where a defender couldn't reach it.

One of the nine defensive positions on a baseball team, consistin<mark>g</mark> of (in scorekeepers' numerical order): (1) pitcher, (2) catcher, (3) first baseman, (4) second baseman, (5) third baseman, (6) shortstop, (7) left fielder, (8) center fielder, (9) ri<mark>g</mark>ht fielder. Positions 3 throu<mark>g</mark>h 6 are called infield positions. Positions 7, 8, and 9 are outfield positions. The pitcher and catcher are the battery. For purposes of the infield fly rule the pitcher and catcher are counted as infielders, and such a broader definition of infielders is commonly used, if only to differentiate them from outfielders. Players in positions 2 throu<mark>g</mark>h 9—all positions except the pitcher—are position players.
A defensive player also positions himself differently—sets up in a different location on the field while playin<mark>g</mark> his position—dependin<mark>g</mark> on who is pitchin<mark>g</mark>, who is at bat, whether runners are on base, the number of outs, and the score of the <mark>g</mark>ame.

A player who becomes nervous or chokes when opposin<mark>g</mark> players or fans yell at or razz them is said to have rabbit ears. Also, an umpire who picks up on every complaint hurled at them from the du<mark>g</mark>outs is described this way.

Rain delay refers to situations when a <mark>g</mark>ame starts late due to rain or is temporarily suspended due to rain. A <mark>g</mark>ame that is suspended after it has be<mark>g</mark>un may be resumed either the same day or at a later date. A <mark>g</mark>ame that never be<mark>g</mark>ins, or that is canceled after it be<mark>g</mark>ins, due to rain is a rainout and in most cases will be rescheduled for a later date – a make-up date. In the event of a non-tie <mark>g</mark>ame past the 5th innin<mark>g</mark> with heavy inclement weather, the <mark>g</mark>ame may be called with the winner bein<mark>g</mark> the team that was ahead at the end of the last completed innin<mark>g</mark> (except durin<mark>g</mark> the MLB postseason).

A rainout refers to a <mark>g</mark>ame that is canceled or stopped in pro<mark>g</mark>ress due to rain. Generally, Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball teams will continue play in li<mark>g</mark>ht to moderate rain but will suspend play if it is rainin<mark>g</mark> heavily or if there is standin<mark>g</mark> water on the field. Games can also be delayed or canceled for other forms of inclement weather, or if the field is found to be unfit for play. If a <mark>g</mark>ame is rained out before play be<mark>g</mark>ins, a make-up <mark>g</mark>ame is rescheduled for a later date. If a <mark>g</mark>ame is called after play be<mark>g</mark>ins but before 4½ innin<mark>g</mark>s have been completed (if the home team is ahead) or five innin<mark>g</mark>s have been completed (if the visitors are ahead or the <mark>g</mark>ame is tied), the <mark>g</mark>ame is not an official <mark>g</mark>ame. The umpire declares "No Game", the <mark>g</mark>ame is played in its entirety at a later date, and statistics compiled durin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>ame are not counted.

In the MLB postseason, however, <mark>g</mark>ames that are called before 4+1⁄2 innin<mark>g</mark>s have been completed are treated as suspended <mark>g</mark>ames, and fans are usually <mark>g</mark>iven a rain check to attend another <mark>g</mark>ame.

The Mets were down three <mark>g</mark>ames to two and losin<mark>g</mark> the decidin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>ame to the Red Sox, when in the seventh innin<mark>g</mark>, television cameras showed some of the New York Mets players in the du<mark>g</mark>out wearin<mark>g</mark> their caps inside-out.

re<mark>g</mark>ular season
The 162-<mark>g</mark>ame schedule that all Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball teams usually complete. However, if a special one-<mark>g</mark>ame playoff is required to determine which team <mark>g</mark>oes to the lea<mark>g</mark>ue division championship series (the ALDS or the NLDS), this 163rd <mark>g</mark>ame is also counted as part of the re<mark>g</mark>ular season. All team and player statistics from this <mark>g</mark>ame are also counted as re<mark>g</mark>ular season statistics. For example, if a pitcher wins his 20th <mark>g</mark>ame in the 163rd <mark>g</mark>ame played in the one-<mark>g</mark>ame playoff, he would be a "20 <mark>g</mark>ame winner" for the season. Similarly, a batter's performance in that extra <mark>g</mark>ame mi<mark>g</mark>ht determine whether he wins the title for best battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e or most home runs in the season.
On occasion, teams do not complete every <mark>g</mark>ame of the re<mark>g</mark>ular season, as when playin<mark>g</mark> a make-up <mark>g</mark>ame and the outcome of that <mark>g</mark>ame could not possibly help either team reach the playoffs.
re<mark>g</mark>ulation <mark>g</mark>ame
A standard baseball <mark>g</mark>ame lasts nine innin<mark>g</mark>s, althou<mark>g</mark>h some lea<mark>g</mark>ues (such as hi<mark>g</mark>h school baseball) use seven-innin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>ames. The team with the most runs at the end of the <mark>g</mark>ame wins. If the home team is ahead after ei<mark>g</mark>ht-and-a-half innin<mark>g</mark>s have been played, it is declared the winner, and the last half-innin<mark>g</mark> is not played. If the home team is trailin<mark>g</mark> or tied in the last innin<mark>g</mark> and they score to take the lead, the <mark>g</mark>ame ends as soon as the winnin<mark>g</mark> run touches home plate; however, if the last batter hits a home run to win the <mark>g</mark>ame, he and any runners on base are all permitted to score.
If both teams have scored the same number of runs at the end of a re<mark>g</mark>ular-len<mark>g</mark>th <mark>g</mark>ame, a tie is avoided by the addition of extra innin<mark>g</mark>s.[256] As many innin<mark>g</mark>s as necessary are played until one team has the lead at the end of an innin<mark>g</mark>. Thus, the home team always has a chance to respond if the visitin<mark>g</mark> team scores in the top half of the innin<mark>g</mark>; this <mark>g</mark>ives the home team a small tactical advanta<mark>g</mark>e. In theory, a baseball <mark>g</mark>ame could <mark>g</mark>o on forever; in practice, however, they eventually end (althou<mark>g</mark>h see Lon<mark>g</mark>est professional baseball <mark>g</mark>ame).
rehab assi<mark>g</mark>nment
When a Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue player recoverin<mark>g</mark> from injury or illness plays a short stint with one of the team's minor-lea<mark>g</mark>ue affiliates before comin<mark>g</mark> off the disabled list. The particular affiliate may be chosen based on its proximity to the club's home town rather than the level of play. A rehab assi<mark>g</mark>nment does not carry the same sti<mark>g</mark>ma as bein<mark>g</mark> sent down to the minors for poor performance.

A defensive technique where the ball is thrown by an outfielder to an infielder who then throws to the final tar<mark>g</mark>et.

Also the second throw durin<mark>g</mark> a double play. As in "They were only able to <mark>g</mark>et the lead runner because the relay was not in time."

Main article: Startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher
A startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three or four days after pitchin<mark>g</mark> a <mark>g</mark>ame before pitchin<mark>g</mark> another. Therefore, most professional baseball teams have four or five startin<mark>g</mark> pitchers on their roster. These pitchers, and the sequence in which they pitch, are known as "the rotation" or "startin<mark>g</mark> rotation". In modern baseball, a five-man rotation is most common.
Often a mana<mark>g</mark>er identifies pitchers by their order in the rotation, "number 1", "number 2", etc. "Discussions over whether Jason Schmidt or Brad Penny is more deservin<mark>g</mark> to occupy the No. 2 spot in the startin<mark>g</mark> rotation behind Derek Lowe can cease, as least temporarily."[263]

A pitcher is said to have a "rubber arm" if he can throw many pitches without tirin<mark>g</mark>. Relief pitchers who have the ability to pitch consecutive days with the same effectiveness tend to be known as "rubber arms". Examples of these include Justin Verlander and Aroldis Chapman.

A play in which a runner is stranded between two bases, and runs back and forth to try to avoid fielders with the ball. The fielders (usually basemen) toss the ball back and forth, to prevent the runner from <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> to a base, and typically close in on him and ta<mark>g</mark> him. Also called a hotbox or a pickle. Sometimes used as a baserunnin<mark>g</mark> strate<mark>g</mark>y by a trailin<mark>g</mark> runner, to distract the fielders and allow a leadin<mark>g</mark> runner to advance.

In baseball statistics, save (abbreviated SV, or sometimes, S) is the successful maintenance of a lead by a relief pitcher, usually the closer, until the end of the <mark>g</mark>ame. A save is credited to a pitcher who fulfills the followin<mark>g</mark> three conditions:
The pitcher is the last pitcher in a <mark>g</mark>ame won by his team;
The pitcher is not the winnin<mark>g</mark> pitcher (For instance, if a startin<mark>g</mark> pitcher throws a complete <mark>g</mark>ame win or, alternatively, if the pitcher <mark>g</mark>ets a blown save and then his team scores a winnin<mark>g</mark> run while he is the pitcher of record, sometimes known as a "vulture win".);
The pitcher fulfills at least one of the followin<mark>g</mark> three conditions:
He comes into the <mark>g</mark>ame with a lead of no more than three runs.
He comes into the <mark>g</mark>ame with the potential tyin<mark>g</mark> run bein<mark>g</mark> either on base, at bat, or on deck.
He pitches effectively for at least three innin<mark>g</mark>s after enterin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>ame with a lead and finishes the <mark>g</mark>ame.
If the pitcher surrenders the lead at any point, he cannot <mark>g</mark>et a save, even if his team comes back to win. No more than one save may be credited in each <mark>g</mark>ame.
If a relief pitcher satisfies all the criteria for a save, except he does not finish the <mark>g</mark>ame, he will often be credited with a hold.
The third rule can be contentious, as it is subject to the jud<mark>g</mark>ment of the official scorer.
The last criterion in that rule can lead to ludicrous results. On Au<mark>g</mark>ust 22, 2007, the Texas Ran<mark>g</mark>ers beat the Baltimore Orioles by a score of 30 to 3. The winnin<mark>g</mark> pitcher, Kason Gabbard, pitched six innin<mark>g</mark>s, and left the <mark>g</mark>ame with a 14–3 lead. The Ran<mark>g</mark>ers' relief pitcher, Wes Littleton, pitched three scoreless innin<mark>g</mark>s, while his team went on to score another 16 runs, includin<mark>g</mark> six runs in the 9th innin<mark>g</mark>. In return for protectin<mark>g</mark> his team's lead for the last three innin<mark>g</mark>s, Littleton was awarded a "save".[266]
Generally, a save situation is when a pitcher enters the <mark>g</mark>ame in the seventh innin<mark>g</mark> or later with a lead of three runs or fewer, or with the potential tyin<mark>g</mark> run in the on-deck circle. Most of the time, the savin<mark>g</mark> pitcher pitches one or more innin<mark>g</mark>s. Also called a save opportunity.

When a pitcher <mark>g</mark>ets a batter to hit the ball on the handle, and the batter hits the ball weakly or even breaks his bat, the pitcher may be said to have sawed off the bat. "If the bat handles are <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> "sawed off" in players' hands or shatterin<mark>g</mark> into splinters, it's because players are orderin<mark>g</mark> bats too thin to withstand the impact of a 90 mile-per-hour fast ball."[267]

Less commonly used for a ball that takes an unusual lateral bounce to elude an infielder. Sometimes called a seein<mark>g</mark>-eye sin<mark>g</mark>le. See <mark>g</mark>round ball with eyes.

If a coach si<mark>g</mark>nals for a runner to attempt to steal a base, he is "sendin<mark>g</mark>" a runner. Similarly, a third-base coach who si<mark>g</mark>nals to a runner who is approachin<mark>g</mark> third base that he should turn toward home plate and attempt to score, the coach is "sendin<mark>g</mark>" the runner home.[271]

A major lea<mark>g</mark>ue player may be sent down or demoted to a minor lea<mark>g</mark>ue team either before or durin<mark>g</mark> the season. When this occurs durin<mark>g</mark> the season, another player is usually called up or promoted from the minor lea<mark>g</mark>ues or placed on the active roster after bein<mark>g</mark> removed from the disabled list.

When a pitcher is removed from the lineup, he is sometimes said to be "sent to the showers" because his work for the day is done. Theoretically it is possible for him to be removed as pitcher and kept in the lineup as a desi<mark>g</mark>nated hitter or even as a position player. But this is a very rare occurrence in the professional <mark>g</mark>ame, and is more frequent in the amateur <mark>g</mark>ame, especially in NCAA competition.

A set of <mark>g</mark>ames between two teams. Durin<mark>g</mark> the re<mark>g</mark>ular season, teams typically play 3- or 4-<mark>g</mark>ame series a<mark>g</mark>ainst one another, with all the <mark>g</mark>ames in each series played in the same park. The set of all <mark>g</mark>ames played between two teams durin<mark>g</mark> the re<mark>g</mark>ular season is referred to as the season series. For <mark>g</mark>ames played between teams in a sin<mark>g</mark>le lea<mark>g</mark>ue, the re<mark>g</mark>ular season series includes an equal number of <mark>g</mark>ames in the home parks of each team. Its purpose is to minimize travel costs and disruptions in the very lon<mark>g</mark> major lea<mark>g</mark>ue baseball season.
In the playoffs, series involve <mark>g</mark>ames played in the home stadiums of both teams. Teams hope to <mark>g</mark>ain from havin<mark>g</mark> a home field advanta<mark>g</mark>e by playin<mark>g</mark> the first <mark>g</mark>ame(s) in their own ballpark.

Where all infielders and/or outfielders position themselves clockwise or counter-clockwise from their usual position. This is to anticipate a batted ball from a batter who tends to hit to one side of the field. Also shade. In the case of some batters, especially with left-handed batters and the bases empty, mana<mark>g</mark>ers have been known to shift fielders from the left side to the ri<mark>g</mark>ht side of the diamond. The most extreme case was the famous "Ted Williams shift" (also once called the "Lou Boudreau shift").

A ball that bounces immediately in front of an infielder. If the batter is a fast runner, an infielder may intentionally "short hop the ball" (take the ball on the short hop) to hasten his throw to first base. Balls may be short-hopped to turn a double play, but it may backfire sometimes. For example, Carlos Guillén had a <mark>g</mark>round ball that bounced to him, and he short hopped it, however, it went off his <mark>g</mark>love and went hi<mark>g</mark>h in the air.

shorten the <mark>g</mark>ame
A team that has a stron<mark>g</mark> staff of relief pitchers is sometimes said to have the ability to shorten <mark>g</mark>ames: "The Ti<mark>g</mark>ers will be fearsome postseason opponents because of their bullpen's ability to shorten <mark>g</mark>ames."[274] If the team <mark>g</mark>ets ahead in the first six innin<mark>g</mark>s, its bullpen can be counted on to hold the lead; thus the opponent needs to <mark>g</mark>rab an early lead to still have a chance in the last few innin<mark>g</mark>s to win the <mark>g</mark>ame.

When a batter chan<mark>g</mark>es his stance so that he appears ready to bunt the ball, he's said to "show bunt". Sometimes this move is intended to make the infielders creep in toward home plate, but the hitter swin<mark>g</mark>s away instead. And sometimes it's intended to cause the pitcher to chan<mark>g</mark>e his pitch. See also butcher boy.

An easy-to-hit ball thrown by a pitcher to a batter who has fouled off many balls in that particular at-bat, so riskin<mark>g</mark> an excessive pitch count. While the likelihood of an extra-base hit is hi<mark>g</mark>h, there is also a chance that the batter will strike out or put the ball in play where it can be fielded. Either way, a show-me pitch usually finishes the at-bat quickly.
Also used to describe a specific pitch in a pitcher's repertoire that is weaker than their other offerin<mark>g</mark>s, particularly one that is rarely thrown. "Mahle's slider has always been more show-me pitch than put-away weapon."[275]

Accordin<mark>g</mark> to the Dickson dictionary, the term derives from horseracin<mark>g</mark>, in which a bettor arrives at the window too late to place a bet, due to the race already havin<mark>g</mark> started, so the bettor is said to be "shut out" (this specific usa<mark>g</mark>e was referenced in the film The Stin<mark>g</mark>).
A team shuts out its opponent when it prevents them from scorin<mark>g</mark> any runs in a <mark>g</mark>iven <mark>g</mark>ame.
"Santana shut out the Royals with a 3-hitter" means that the Royals went scoreless as Santana pitched a complete-<mark>g</mark>ame shutout. The pitcher or pitchers on the winnin<mark>g</mark> team thus <mark>g</mark>et statistical credit for an individual shutout or a combined-to-pitch-shutout, respectively.

si<mark>g</mark>n
Non-verbal <mark>g</mark>estures used by catchers and coaches to communicate team strate<mark>g</mark>y:
A catcher is said to call the <mark>g</mark>ame by sendin<mark>g</mark> si<mark>g</mark>ns to the pitcher callin<mark>g</mark> for a particular pitch. After he moves into his crouch, the catcher <mark>g</mark>ives the si<mark>g</mark>n by placin<mark>g</mark> his non-<mark>g</mark>love hand between his le<mark>g</mark>s and usin<mark>g</mark> his fist, fin<mark>g</mark>ers, wa<mark>g</mark>s, or taps a<mark>g</mark>ainst his inner thi<mark>g</mark>h to tell the pitcher what type of pitch to throw (fastball, curve, etc.) as well as the location. A pitcher may shake off (shake his head "no" to) the initial si<mark>g</mark>n or nod in a<mark>g</mark>reement when he receives the si<mark>g</mark>n that he wants before <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> into his windup. If there is a runner on second base, a catcher may chan<mark>g</mark>e the location of his <mark>g</mark>love (from his knee to the <mark>g</mark>round, for example) to si<mark>g</mark>nal the pitcher that he is usin<mark>g</mark> an alternate set of si<mark>g</mark>ns so that the runner won't be able to steal the si<mark>g</mark>n.
A coach sends si<mark>g</mark>ns to players on the field, typically usin<mark>g</mark> a sequence of hand movements. He may send si<mark>g</mark>ns to offensive players, includin<mark>g</mark> batters and runners, about what to do on the next pitch—for example, to sacrifice bunt, to take or to swin<mark>g</mark> away at the next pitch; to steal a base; or to execute a hit-and-run. He may send si<mark>g</mark>ns to the catcher to call for a pitchout or to intentionally walk the batter.

sittin<mark>g</mark> on a pitch
A batter who is waitin<mark>g</mark> for a particular type of pitch before swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> at it. He may be sittin<mark>g</mark> in wait for, say, a curveball or a chan<mark>g</mark>e-up, or a pitch thrown in a certain location, and he won't swin<mark>g</mark> at anythin<mark>g</mark> else even if it's down the middle of the plate. Sometimes hitters who know a pitcher's pattern of pitches, or what type of pitch he likes to throw in a <mark>g</mark>iven count, sit on that particular pitch. This approach stems from the advice Ro<mark>g</mark>ers Hornsby <mark>g</mark>ave to Ted Williams, tellin<mark>g</mark> him that the secret to hittin<mark>g</mark> was simply to "wait for a <mark>g</mark>ood pitch to hit".

Left-hander, especially a pitcher. Most baseball stadiums are built so that home plate is in the west and the outfield is in the east, so that when the sun sets it is not in the batter's eye. Because of this, a left-handed pitcher's arm is always facin<mark>g</mark> south when he faces the plate. Thus he has a "southpaw".

A pitcher who starts an occasional <mark>g</mark>ame (perhaps only one <mark>g</mark>ame) who is not a re<mark>g</mark>ular starter in the rotation. This is a pitcher who is already on a team's roster and usually works as a relief pitcher. In contrast to a spot starter, who is already on the roster, an emer<mark>g</mark>ency starter is typically a player who is brou<mark>g</mark>ht up from the minor lea<mark>g</mark>ues on very short notice because a re<mark>g</mark>ular starter is injured. Sometimes, however, even a player who is already on the roster may be referred to as an emer<mark>g</mark>ency starter if his startin<mark>g</mark> role arises because the re<mark>g</mark>ularly scheduled starter has been injured.
In recent years, the term "spot starter" has more commonly been used to describe a pitcher called up from the minors specifically to make one start before bein<mark>g</mark> optioned back down to the minors immediately followin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>ame, particularly when the pitcher in question is the 26th man added to the active roster for a scheduled doubleheader.

When a batter turns his stance from bein<mark>g</mark> sideways to the pitcher's mound to facin<mark>g</mark> the pitcher's mound. This is typically done when a batter prepares to bunt a ball, in particular when he intends to do a sacrifice bunt.

Your knees should be bent and your bat should be held out in front of your body. The barrel of the bat should be at the same hei<mark>g</mark>ht as your eyes and at the top of the strike zone".[287]

A tactic used to attempt to score a runner from third on a bunt. There are two types of squeeze plays: suicide squeeze and safety squeeze. In a suicide squeeze, the runner takes off towards home plate as soon as the pitcher be<mark>g</mark>ins his throw toward home plate. In a safety squeeze, the runner waits until the batter makes contact with the ball before committin<mark>g</mark> himself to try to reach home.

stealin<mark>g</mark> si<mark>g</mark>ns
Main article: si<mark>g</mark>n stealing
When a team that is at bat tries to see the si<mark>g</mark>n the catcher is <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> to the pitcher (indicatin<mark>g</mark> what type of pitch to throw), the team is said to be stealin<mark>g</mark> si<mark>g</mark>ns. This may be done by a runner who is on base (typically second base) watchin<mark>g</mark> the catcher's si<mark>g</mark>ns to the pitcher and <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> a si<mark>g</mark>nal of some kind to the batter. (To prevent this, the pitcher and catcher may chan<mark>g</mark>e their si<mark>g</mark>ns when there is a runner on second base.) Sometimes a first-base or third-base coach mi<mark>g</mark>ht see a catcher's si<mark>g</mark>ns if the catcher isn't careful. In unusual cases, the si<mark>g</mark>ns may be read throu<mark>g</mark>h binoculars by somebody sittin<mark>g</mark> in the stands, perhaps in center field, and sendin<mark>g</mark> a si<mark>g</mark>nal to the hitter in some way.
When a hitter is suspected of peekin<mark>g</mark> to see how a catcher is settin<mark>g</mark> up behind the plate as a clue to what pitch mi<mark>g</mark>ht be comin<mark>g</mark> or what the intended location is, then the pitcher will usually send the hitter a messa<mark>g</mark>e: stick it in his ear.
steppin<mark>g</mark> in the bucket
A phrase for an "open" battin<mark>g</mark> stance, in which the hitter's leadin<mark>g</mark> foot is ali<mark>g</mark>ned away from the plate (toward left field for a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-handed batter). The stance reduces power in the swin<mark>g</mark> and slows the hitter's exit toward first base; however, many players believe it allows them to see the pitch better, and more naturally drive the ball to the opposite field.

Said of an infielder who secures a batted or thrown ball, but chooses to hold the ball rather than throwin<mark>g</mark> to try for an out. For example, a shortstop mi<mark>g</mark>ht ran<mark>g</mark>e in the hole to field a <mark>g</mark>round ball, but then elect to "stick it in his pocket" rather than attemptin<mark>g</mark> to throw to first base to put out the batter-runner, whether to avoid the possibility of a throwin<mark>g</mark> error or to prevent another runner on base from advancin<mark>g</mark> on the throw. Often happens on a ball hit so slowly that, by the time it's fielded, the runner(s) have already advanced so far that a throw and catch for a force out is unlikely or impossible.

In baseball, a stolen base (or "steal") occurs when a baserunner successfully advances to the next base while the pitcher is deliverin<mark>g</mark> the ball to home plate. In baseball statistics, stolen bases are denoted by SB. If the catcher thwarts the stolen base by throwin<mark>g</mark> the runner out, the event is recorded as cau<mark>g</mark>ht stealin<mark>g</mark> (CS). Also see uncontested steal.

To pitch from a stretch is to be<mark>g</mark>in the pitchin<mark>g</mark> motion by facin<mark>g</mark> sideways relative to home plate, raisin<mark>g</mark> one's arms at the elbow and brin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>love hand and pitchin<mark>g</mark> hand to<mark>g</mark>ether in a full stop, then hurlin<mark>g</mark> the ball toward the plate. This is the usual pitchin<mark>g</mark> motion when there are men on base, so that the pitcher can check on the runners before throwin<mark>g</mark> home. Sometimes, however, pitchers use a stretch even when the bases are empty.

However, a series between the Los An<mark>g</mark>eles Dod<mark>g</mark>ers and the Los An<mark>g</mark>eles An<mark>g</mark>els would not be a subway series, because there is no subway or other rail service between Dod<mark>g</mark>er Stadium and An<mark>g</mark>el Stadium of Anaheim (not even the fabled but fanciful line between "Anaheim, Azusa and Cuc ... amon<mark>g</mark>a").[297] Instead such a series is referred to as a freeway series.
After winnin<mark>g</mark> a weekend series in colle<mark>g</mark>e baseball, the team will party Sunday ni<mark>g</mark>ht. This is because colle<mark>g</mark>e teams play five ni<mark>g</mark>hts a week and have no free time to party except on Sundays, because they can rest on their required Monday off day.

The meat of the bat.[298] "Batters know from experience that there is a sweet spot on the bat, about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) from the end of the barrel, where the shock of the impact, felt by the hands, is reduced to such an extent that the batter is almost unaware of the collision.

When a batter is followin<mark>g</mark> his coach's advice to not bunt (never mind those runners), he is said to "swin<mark>g</mark> away".
"Swin<mark>g</mark> for the downs" means swin<mark>g</mark> mi<mark>g</mark>htily – all or nothin<mark>g</mark>.
Attemptin<mark>g</mark> a home run is to "swin<mark>g</mark> for the fences".
"Swin<mark>g</mark> from the heels" means swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> very hard, hopin<mark>g</mark> for an extra base hit.
A "swin<mark>g</mark>man" is a pitcher with relatively <mark>g</mark>ood stamina who can function as either a lon<mark>g</mark> reliever or a starter, e.<mark>g</mark>. Justin Masterson durin<mark>g</mark> his time with the Red Sox.[302]

ta<mark>g</mark> up
When a batter hits a ball that is cau<mark>g</mark>ht before touchin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>round (he is out) every runner must retreat back to the base he just left. Once he has touched that base (ta<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed up), he may le<mark>g</mark>ally advance a<mark>g</mark>ain. If he fails to ta<mark>g</mark> up he can be called out on appeal.
tail<mark>g</mark>ate
A catcher's butt. In the phrase "he didn't keep his tail<mark>g</mark>ate down" an announcer means a pitched ball was very low or even hit the dirt and went between the catcher's le<mark>g</mark>s.

When a batter decides not to swin<mark>g</mark> at a pitch, he "takes the pitch." He may do this followin<mark>g</mark> the instruction of a coach who has <mark>g</mark>iven him a take si<mark>g</mark>n.
take si<mark>g</mark>n
The si<mark>g</mark>nal from a coach for the batter to not swin<mark>g</mark> at the next pitch—to "take" it. Sometimes when a new pitcher or a reliever comes in, batters are <mark>g</mark>iven a <mark>g</mark>eneral instruction to take the first pitch. Most often, they are told to take a pitch when the count is 3–0.
take somethin<mark>g</mark> off the pitch
To throw an off-speed pitch or to throw a <mark>g</mark>iven pitch slower than the pitcher usually throws it.

To issue an intentional walk. By doin<mark>g</mark> so, a pitcher reduces the potential dama<mark>g</mark>e from allowin<mark>g</mark> the batter to swin<mark>g</mark> at and hit a pitch. "Buck Showalter took the bat out of Barry Bonds' hands with an unheard-of strate<mark>g</mark>y – a bases-loaded intentional walk.

A slide performed for the purpose of hamperin<mark>g</mark> the play of the defense. A runner from first to second base will often try to "take out" the fielder at the base to disrupt his throw to first base and "break up the double play". Althou<mark>g</mark>h the runner is supposed to stay within the base-paths, as lon<mark>g</mark> as he touches second base he has a lot of leeway to use his body. Runners in this situation usually need to slide in order to avoid bein<mark>g</mark> hit by the throw from second to first; but whether they do a "take-out slide" or come into the base with their spikes hi<mark>g</mark>h in the air depends as much on their personal disposition as it does the situation. The title of a bio<mark>g</mark>raphy of Ty Cobb—"The Ti<mark>g</mark>er Wore Spikes"—says somethin<mark>g</mark> about how he ran the basepaths.[304]
Before the 2015 season, "runners were <mark>g</mark>iven a <mark>g</mark>ood deal of leeway when slidin<mark>g</mark> into a base in an attempt to break up a double play." After some infielders were injured on rou<mark>g</mark>h plays durin<mark>g</mark> that season, notably when Chase Utley slid into Ruben Tejada durin<mark>g</mark> the National Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Divisional playoffs and broke his le<mark>g</mark>, Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball instituted the "bona-fide slide" rule.[305] The runner must make contact with the <mark>g</mark>round before reachin<mark>g</mark> the base, he must be able to reach the base with a hand or foot, he must be able to remain on the base at the completion of the slide (except at home plate) and he must not chan<mark>g</mark>e his path for the purpose of initiatin<mark>g</mark> contact with a fielder.

An especially lon<mark>g</mark> home run. The term ori<mark>g</mark>inated from a 1953 <mark>g</mark>ame in which Mickey Mantle hit a ball out of Griffith Stadium in Washin<mark>g</mark>ton, D.C. The distance the ball flew was measured and the next day a picture of Mantle with a tape measure was published in the newspaper. A play-by-play announcer may also call a lon<mark>g</mark> home run a tape measure job. Althou<mark>g</mark>h fans have always been interested in how far home runs may travel and in comparin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>reat home runs of the <mark>g</mark>reat and not-so-<mark>g</mark>reat home run hitters, the science of measurin<mark>g</mark> home runs remains inexact.[306][307]

Texas Lea<mark>g</mark>uer
A Texas Lea<mark>g</mark>uer (or Texas Lea<mark>g</mark>ue sin<mark>g</mark>le) is a weakly hit fly ball that drops in for a sin<mark>g</mark>le between an infielder and an outfielder. This is now more commonly referred to as a flare, blooper, or "bloop sin<mark>g</mark>le". It is most colorfully called a '<mark>g</mark>ork shot' or a 'duck snort.' See blooper.

Accordin<mark>g</mark> to the April 21, 1906, edition of The Sportin<mark>g</mark> Life,[308] John McCloskey, founder of the Texas Lea<mark>g</mark>ue and then-mana<mark>g</mark>er of the Houston Mudcats – who would later <mark>g</mark>o onto mana<mark>g</mark>e the St. Louis Cardinals – si<mark>g</mark>ned 22-year-old Pickerin<mark>g</mark> to play center field on the mornin<mark>g</mark> of May 21, 1892.

The three ways a plate appearance can end without fielders comin<mark>g</mark> into play: walks, home runs, and strikeouts. Baseball Prospectus coined the term in homa<mark>g</mark>e to Rob Deer, who excelled at producin<mark>g</mark> all three outcomes. The statistical result of the three true outcomes on a player's slash line is a low battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e, as well as an unusually hi<mark>g</mark>h on-base percenta<mark>g</mark>e relative to the battin<mark>g</mark> avera<mark>g</mark>e. Traditionally, players with a hi<mark>g</mark>h percenta<mark>g</mark>e of their plate appearances endin<mark>g</mark> in one of the three true outcomes are underrated,[citation needed] as <mark>g</mark>eneral mana<mark>g</mark>ers often overestimate the harm in strikin<mark>g</mark> out, and underestimate the value of a walk.

For instance, a sin<mark>g</mark>le, then a strikeout, then a double play is a three up three down innin<mark>g</mark>, but not a 1-2-3 innin<mark>g</mark>. See also: side retired, 1-2-3 innin<mark>g</mark>.
throu<mark>g</mark>h the wickets
When a batted ball passes throu<mark>g</mark>h the le<mark>g</mark>s of a player on the field (most commonly an infielder) it's often said, "That one went ri<mark>g</mark>ht throu<mark>g</mark>h the wickets." The term refers to the metal arches (called wickets) used in the <mark>g</mark>ame of croquet throu<mark>g</mark>h which balls are hit. Lettin<mark>g</mark> the ball throu<mark>g</mark>h his le<mark>g</mark>s makes a baseball player look (and feel) inept, and the official scorekeeper typically records the play as an error.

When a fielder throws the ball so hard it appears to hardly arc at all, he has "thrown a clothesline". Akin to a line drive's bein<mark>g</mark> described as a rope or frozen rope.

A pitcher who throws the ball hard in the direction of home plate but without much accuracy or command. Distin<mark>g</mark>uished from a "pitcher", who may or may not throw the ball as hard but who has command and is likely to be more successful in <mark>g</mark>ettin<mark>g</mark> batters out.
throwin<mark>g</mark> seeds/throwin<mark>g</mark> the pill/throwin<mark>g</mark> BBs
When a pitcher's fastball is so <mark>g</mark>ood it seems as thou<mark>g</mark>h the baseball is the size of a seed (or pill or BB), and just about as hittable.

A run can be scored on the same play as the third out, but only if the third out is not a force out, and is not made by the batter before reachin<mark>g</mark> first base. In order for the run to count, the runner must reach home plate before the third out is made elsewhere on the field, so the play is known as a "time play".[311]
tin <mark>g</mark>love
A poor fieldin<mark>g</mark> (defensive) player is often said to have a "tin <mark>g</mark>love", as if his baseball mitt was made of inflexible metal. This is a sarcastic reference to the <mark>g</mark>old <mark>g</mark>love awarded for defensive excellence.[citation needed]

When a pitcher inadvertently si<mark>g</mark>nals what type pitch is next, he is said to be "tippin<mark>g</mark>" or "tele<mark>g</mark>raphin<mark>g</mark>" them. It may be somethin<mark>g</mark> in his position on the rubber, his body lean, how he holds or moves his <mark>g</mark>love when <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> into the stretch, whether he moves his index fin<mark>g</mark>er outside his <mark>g</mark>love, or some aspect of his pitchin<mark>g</mark> motion. Akin to what is called a tell in poker: a habit, behavior, or physical reaction that <mark>g</mark>ives other players more information about your hand.
Coaches as well as players on the bench make a habit of watchin<mark>g</mark> everythin<mark>g</mark> an opposin<mark>g</mark> pitcher is doin<mark>g</mark>, lookin<mark>g</mark> for information that will allow them to forecast what kind of pitch is comin<mark>g</mark>. When pitchers <mark>g</mark>o throu<mark>g</mark>h a bad spell, they may become paranoid that they're tippin<mark>g</mark> their pitches to the opposin<mark>g</mark> batters. A pitcher and coaches are likely to spend a lot of time studyin<mark>g</mark> film of the <mark>g</mark>ames to learn what the pitcher mi<mark>g</mark>ht be doin<mark>g</mark> that tips his pitches.
Pitchers will try to hide their <mark>g</mark>rip even while deliverin<mark>g</mark> the ball. Rick Sutcliffe used to wind up in such a way that his body concealed the ball from the batter almost until the moment of release. In contrast, relief ace Dennis Eckersley, playin<mark>g</mark> a psycholo<mark>g</mark>ical <mark>g</mark>ame, would hold the ball up in such a way that he purposely showed off the type of <mark>g</mark>rip he had on it, essentially "darin<mark>g</mark>" the batter to hit it.

To hit a hi<mark>g</mark>h pitch, perhaps one that's out of the strike zone, so that the batter may appear to be swin<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> downwards as if his bat is a tomahawk.

A batter who has speed and a propensity to <mark>g</mark>et on base, and who thus may be suited to be the lead-off or second hitter in the line-up. "I think Brett Jackson looks a lot more like a top of the order <mark>g</mark>uy ri<mark>g</mark>ht now than a middle of the order <mark>g</mark>uy, and he seems like a viable leadoff hitter based on his performance as a professional."[citation needed]

To field a ball, typically a <mark>g</mark>round ball that a fielder has to travel some distance to stop or a fly ball that an outfielder has to run far to catch. "Mike Cameron, Milwaukee Brewers, can track down flies with the best centerfielders in baseball today."[316]

When a fielder attempts to catch a batted baseball in the air but the ball hits the <mark>g</mark>round just before it enters the fielder's <mark>g</mark>love, the fielder is said to have "trapped the ball".

When three outs are made on one play. This is rare. While a typical <mark>g</mark>ame may have several double plays, a typical season has only a few triple plays. This is primarily because the circumstances are rather specific—that there be at least two runners, and no outs, and that typically one of these circumstances occurs: (1) the batter hits a sharp <mark>g</mark>rounder to the third baseman, who touches the base, throws to second base to <mark>g</mark>et the second out, and the second baseman or shortstop relays the ball to first quickly enou<mark>g</mark>h to <mark>g</mark>et the batter-runner for the third out (also called a 5-4-3 or 5-6-3 triple play, respectively); OR (2) the runners are off on the pitch, in a hit-and-run play, but an infielder catches the ball on a line-drive out, and relays to the appropriate bases in time to <mark>g</mark>et two other runners before they can retreat to their bases. The latter situation can also yield an extremely rare unassisted triple play, of which 14 have occurred in the entire history of major lea<mark>g</mark>ue baseball. A second baseman or shortstop will catch the ball, his momentum will carry him to second base to make the second out, and he will run and touch the runner from first before the runner can fully re<mark>g</mark>ain his momentum and turn around back to first.

This is primarily because the circumstances are rather specific—that there be at least two runners, and no outs, and that typically one of these circumstances occurs: (1) the batter hits a sharp <mark>g</mark>rounder to the third baseman, who touches the base, throws to second base to <mark>g</mark>et the second out, and the second baseman or shortstop relays the ball to first quickly enou<mark>g</mark>h to <mark>g</mark>et the batter-runner for the third out (also called a 5-4-3 or 5-6-3 triple play, respectively); OR (2) the runners are off on the pitch, in a hit-and-run play, but an infielder catches the ball on a line-drive out, and relays to the appropriate bases in time to <mark>g</mark>et two other runners before they can retreat to their bases. The latter situation can also yield an extremely rare unassisted triple play, of which 14 have occurred in the entire history of major lea<mark>g</mark>ue baseball. A second baseman or shortstop will catch the ball, his momentum will carry him to second base to make the second out, and he will run and touch the runner from first before the runner can fully re<mark>g</mark>ain his momentum and turn around back to first.

An old fashioned term for a pitcher. In the early years, pitchers would often twirl their arms in a circle one or more times before deliverin<mark>g</mark> the ball, literally usin<mark>g</mark> a "windup", in the belief it would reduce stress on their arms. The terms "twirler" and "twirlin<mark>g</mark>" faded alon<mark>g</mark> with that motion. The modern term "hurler" is effectively the substitute term.

A term borrowed from American football to describe either a player who can pitch and hit well, or a player who can pitch and play another defensive position well. The most famous Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue ballplayer who was truly a two-way player was Babe Ruth. He started his career as an outstandin<mark>g</mark> pitcher and later played in the outfield—and was one of the <mark>g</mark>reatest home run hitters of all time.

A wild pitch (abbreviated WP) is char<mark>g</mark>ed to a pitcher when, in the opinion of the official scorer, a pitch is too hi<mark>g</mark>h, too low, or too wide of home plate for the catcher to catch the ball with ordinary effort, and which allows one or more runners to advance; or allows the batter to advance to first base, if it is a third strike with first base unoccupied. Neither a passed ball nor a wild pitch is char<mark>g</mark>ed as an error. It is a separate statistic.

Main article: Pitchin<mark>g</mark> position
In baseball, there are two le<mark>g</mark>al pitchin<mark>g</mark> positions: the windup, and the set. The choice of pitchin<mark>g</mark> position may be tactical, as the windup has a <mark>g</mark>enerally slower execution than the set and is thus at <mark>g</mark>reater risk of allowin<mark>g</mark> a stolen base. However, some pitchers, particularly relief pitchers, are more comfortable pitchin<mark>g</mark> from the set position, and thus use it re<mark>g</mark>ardless of the situation.
winnin<mark>g</mark> record
A team that has won 82 <mark>g</mark>ames this year is havin<mark>g</mark> a winnin<mark>g</mark> season, because now they can lose the rest and still not have a total of that many losses.

Trump was unsuccessful in his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but took measures to hinder its functionin<mark>g</mark> and rescinded the individual mandate. Trump sou<mark>g</mark>ht substantial spendin<mark>g</mark> cuts to major welfare pro<mark>g</mark>rams, includin<mark>g</mark> Medicare and Medicaid. He si<mark>g</mark>ned the Great American Outdoors Act, reversed numerous environmental re<mark>g</mark>ulations, and withdrew from the Paris A<mark>g</mark>reement on climate chan<mark>g</mark>e. He si<mark>g</mark>ned criminal justice reform throu<mark>g</mark>h the First Step Act and appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In economic policy, he partially repealed the Dodd–Frank Act and si<mark>g</mark>ned the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He enacted tariffs, tri<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>erin<mark>g</mark> retaliatory tariffs from China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership ne<mark>g</mark>otiations and si<mark>g</mark>ned the United States–Mexico–Canada A<mark>g</mark>reement, a successor a<mark>g</mark>reement to NAFTA. The federal deficit increased under Trump due to spendin<mark>g</mark> increases and tax cuts.

He implemented a controversial family separation policy for mi<mark>g</mark>rants apprehended at the United States–Mexico border. Trump's demand for the federal fundin<mark>g</mark> of a border wall resulted in the lon<mark>g</mark>est US <mark>g</mark>overnment shutdown in history. He deployed federal law enforcement forces in response to the racial unrest in 2020. Trump's "America First" forei<mark>g</mark>n policy was characterized by unilateral actions, disre<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> traditional allies. The administration implemented a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia; denied citizens from several Muslim-majority countries entry into the United States; reco<mark>g</mark>nized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; and brokered the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization a<mark>g</mark>reements between Israel and various Arab states. His administration withdrew United States troops from northern Syria, allowin<mark>g</mark> Turkey to occupy the area. His administration also made a conditional deal with the Taliban to withdraw United States troops from Af<mark>g</mark>hanistan in 2021. Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jon<mark>g</mark>-un three times. Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear a<mark>g</mark>reement and later escalated tensions in the Persian Gulf by orderin<mark>g</mark> the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani.

Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investi<mark>g</mark>ation (2017–2019) concluded that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and that while the prevailin<mark>g</mark> evidence "did not establish that members of the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n conspired or coordinated with the Russian <mark>g</mark>overnment", possible obstructions of justice occurred durin<mark>g</mark> the course of that investi<mark>g</mark>ation.

Trump reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, i<mark>g</mark>nored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in his messa<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark>, and promoted misinformation about unproven treatments and the availability of testin<mark>g</mark>.

Followin<mark>g</mark> his loss in the 2020 presidential election to Biden, Trump refused to concede and initiated an extensive campai<mark>g</mark>n to overturn the results, makin<mark>g</mark> false claims of widespread electoral fraud. On January 6, 2021, durin<mark>g</mark> a rally at the Ellipse, Trump ur<mark>g</mark>ed his supporters to "fi<mark>g</mark>ht like hell" and march to the capitol, where the electoral votes were bein<mark>g</mark> counted by Con<mark>g</mark>ress in order to formalize Biden's victory. A mob of Trump supporters stormed the capitol, suspendin<mark>g</mark> the count and causin<mark>g</mark> Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Con<mark>g</mark>ress to be evacuated. On January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump an unprecedented second time for "incitement of insurrection", but he was later acquitted by the Senate a<mark>g</mark>ain on February 13, after he had already left office. Trump had historically low approval ratin<mark>g</mark>s, and scholars and historians rank his presidency as one of the worst in American history.

Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, sayin<mark>g</mark> he had accepted the recommendations of Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to dismiss Comey. Sessions's recommendation was based on Rosenstein's, while Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be dismissed for his handlin<mark>g</mark> of the conclusion of the FBI investi<mark>g</mark>ation into the Hillary Clinton email controversy.[25] On May 10, Trump met Russian Forei<mark>g</mark>n Minister Ser<mark>g</mark>ey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Ser<mark>g</mark>ey Kislyak. Based on White House notes of the meetin<mark>g</mark>, Trump told the Russians, "I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job ... I faced <mark>g</mark>reat pressure because of Russia. That's taken off."[26] On May 11, Trump said in a videoed interview, "... re<mark>g</mark>ardless of recommendation, I was <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> to fire Comey ... in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thin<mark>g</mark> with Trump and Russia is a made-up story."[27] On May 18, Rosenstein told members of the U.S. Senate that he recommended Comey's dismissal while knowin<mark>g</mark> Trump had already decided to fire Comey.[28] In the aftermath of Comey's firin<mark>g</mark>, the events were compared with those of the "Saturday Ni<mark>g</mark>ht Massacre" durin<mark>g</mark> Richard Nixon's administration and there was debate over whether Trump had provoked a constitutional crisis, as he had dismissed the man leadin<mark>g</mark> an investi<mark>g</mark>ation into Trump's associates.[29] Trump's statements raised concerns of potential obstruction of justice.[30] In Comey's memo about a February 2017 meetin<mark>g</mark> with Trump, Comey said Trump attempted to persuade him to abort the investi<mark>g</mark>ation into Flynn.[31]

After Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate in 2014, only 28.6 percent of judicial nominees were confirmed, "the lowest percenta<mark>g</mark>e of confirmations from 1977 to 2018".[32] At the end of the Obama presidency, 105 jud<mark>g</mark>eships were vacant.[33] Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, prioritized confirmin<mark>g</mark> Trump's judicial appointees, doin<mark>g</mark> so rapidly.[34] By November 2018, Trump had appointed 29 jud<mark>g</mark>es to the U.S. courts of appeals, more than any modern president in the first two years of a presidential term.[35]

Trump made three nominations to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h, and Amy Coney Barrett:
Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch in January 2017 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, which had not been filled by Obama because the Republican-majority Senate did not consider the nomination of Merrick Garland. Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017 in a mostly party-line vote of 54–45.[41] Gorsuch's confirmation was one of Trump's major first year accomplishments, made as part of a "100‑day pled<mark>g</mark>e".[42]
Trump nominated Brett Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h in July 2018 to replace retirin<mark>g</mark> Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was considered a key swin<mark>g</mark> vote on the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h in a mostly party-line vote of 50–48 in October 2018 after alle<mark>g</mark>ations that Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h had attempted to rape another student when they were both in hi<mark>g</mark>h school; Kavanau<mark>g</mark>h denied the alle<mark>g</mark>ation.[43][44]
Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett in September 2020 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsbur<mark>g</mark>. Ginsbur<mark>g</mark> was considered part of the Court's liberal win<mark>g</mark> and her replacement with a conservative jurist substantially chan<mark>g</mark>ed the ideolo<mark>g</mark>ical composition of the Supreme Court.[45] Democrats opposed the nomination, ar<mark>g</mark>uin<mark>g</mark> that the court vacancy should not be filled until after the 2020 presidential election. On October 26, 2020, the Senate confirmed Barrett by a mostly party-line vote of 52–48, with all Democrats opposin<mark>g</mark> her confirmation.[46]

Trump had reportedly fostered chaos as a mana<mark>g</mark>ement technique, resultin<mark>g</mark> in low morale and policy confusion amon<mark>g</mark> his staff.[55][56] Trump proved unable to effectively compromise durin<mark>g</mark> the 115th U.S. Con<mark>g</mark>ress, which led to si<mark>g</mark>nificant <mark>g</mark>overnmental <mark>g</mark>ridlock and few notable le<mark>g</mark>islative accomplishments despite Republican control of both houses of Con<mark>g</mark>ress.[57] Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin found Trump lacked several traits of an effective leader, includin<mark>g</mark> "humility, acknowled<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> errors, shoulderin<mark>g</mark> blame and learnin<mark>g</mark> from mistakes, empathy, resilience, collaboration, connectin<mark>g</mark> with people and controllin<mark>g</mark> unproductive emotions."[58]

In January 2018, Axios reported Trump's workin<mark>g</mark> hours were typically around 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (a later start and an earlier end compared to the be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> of his presidency) and that he was holdin<mark>g</mark> fewer meetin<mark>g</mark>s durin<mark>g</mark> his workin<mark>g</mark> hours in order to accommodate Trump's desire for more unstructured free time (labelled as "executive time").[59] In 2019, Axios published Trump's schedule from November 7, 2018, to February 1, 2019, and calculated that around sixty percent of the time between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. was "executive time."[60]

False and misleadin<mark>g</mark> statements
Fact-checkers from The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post,[61] (oran<mark>g</mark>e) the Toronto Star,[62] and CNN[63] (blue) compiled data on "false or misleadin<mark>g</mark> claims" and "false claims," respectively. The peaks in late 2018 correspond to the midterm elections, in late 2019 to his impeachment inquiry, and in late 2020 to the presidential election. The Post reported 30,573 false or misleadin<mark>g</mark> claims in 4 years,[61] an avera<mark>g</mark>e of more than 20.9 per day.
The number and scale of Trump's statements in public speeches, remarks, and tweets identified as false by scholars, fact-checkers, and commentators were characterized as unprecedented for an American president[64][65] and even unprecedented in U.S. politics.[66] The New Yorker called falsehoods a distinctive part of his political identity,[67] and they have also been described by Republican political advisor Amanda Carpenter as a <mark>g</mark>asli<mark>g</mark>htin<mark>g</mark> tactic.[68] His White House had dismissed the idea of objective truth[69] and his campai<mark>g</mark>n and presidency have been described as bein<mark>g</mark> "post-truth"[70] and hyper-Orwellian.[71] Trump's rhetorical si<mark>g</mark>nature included disre<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> data from federal institutions that was incompatible to his ar<mark>g</mark>uments; quotin<mark>g</mark> hearsay, anecdotal evidence, and questionable claims in partisan media; denyin<mark>g</mark> reality (includin<mark>g</mark> his own statements); and distractin<mark>g</mark> when falsehoods were exposed.[72]

Durin<mark>g</mark> the first year of Trump's presidency, The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post's fact-checkin<mark>g</mark> team wrote that Trump was "the most fact-challen<mark>g</mark>ed politician" it had "ever encountered ... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up."[73] As president, Trump made more than 5,000 false or misleadin<mark>g</mark> claims by September 2018,[74] and by April 2020, Trump had made 18,000 false or misleadin<mark>g</mark> claims while in office, an avera<mark>g</mark>e of more than 15 claims daily.[75] The rate of Trump's false and misleadin<mark>g</mark> statements increased in the weeks precedin<mark>g</mark> the 2018 midterm elections[76] and in the first half of 2020.[75] The most common false or misleadin<mark>g</mark> claims by Trump involved the economy and jobs, his border wall proposal, and his tax le<mark>g</mark>islation;[75] he had also made false statements re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> prior administrations[75] as well as other topics, includin<mark>g</mark> crime, terrorism, immi<mark>g</mark>ration, Russia and the Mueller probe, the Ukraine probe, immi<mark>g</mark>ration, and the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] Senior administration officials had also re<mark>g</mark>ularly <mark>g</mark>iven false, misleadin<mark>g</mark>, or tortured statements to the news media,[77][78] which made it difficult for the news media to take official statements seriously.[77]

Shortly before Trump secured the 2016 Republican nomination, The New York Times reported "le<mark>g</mark>al experts across the political spectrum say" Trump's rhetoric reflected "a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law," addin<mark>g</mark> "many conservative and libertarian le<mark>g</mark>al scholars warn that electin<mark>g</mark> Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis."[79] Political scientists warned that candidate Trump's rhetoric and actions mimicked those of other politicians who ultimately turned authoritarian once in office.[80] Some scholars have concluded that durin<mark>g</mark> Trump's tenure as president and lar<mark>g</mark>ely due to his actions and rhetoric, the U.S. has experienced democratic backslidin<mark>g</mark>.[81][82] Many prominent Republicans have expressed similar concerns that Trump's perceived disre<mark>g</mark>ard for the rule of law betrayed conservative principles.[83][84][85][86]

Durin<mark>g</mark> the first two years of his presidency, Trump repeatedly sou<mark>g</mark>ht to influence the Department of Justice to investi<mark>g</mark>ate Clinton,[87][88] the Democratic National Committee,[89] and Comey.[90] He persistently repeated a variety of alle<mark>g</mark>ations, at least some of which had already been investi<mark>g</mark>ated or debunked.[91][92] In sprin<mark>g</mark> 2018, Trump told White House counsel Don McGahn he wanted to order the Department of Justice to prosecute Clinton and Comey, but McGahn advised Trump such action would constitute abuse of power and invite possible impeachment.[93] In May 2018, Trump demanded that the Department of Justice investi<mark>g</mark>ate "whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campai<mark>g</mark>n for Political Purposes," which the Department of Justice referred to its inspector <mark>g</mark>eneral.[94] Althou<mark>g</mark>h it is not unlawful for a president to exert influence on the Department of Justice to open an investi<mark>g</mark>ation, presidents have assiduously avoided doin<mark>g</mark> so to prevent perceptions of political interference.[94][95]

Trump frequently criticized the independence of the judiciary for unfairly interferin<mark>g</mark> in his administration's ability to decide policy.[100] In November 2018, in an extraordinary rebuke of a sittin<mark>g</mark> president, Roberts criticized Trump's characterization of a jud<mark>g</mark>e who had ruled a<mark>g</mark>ainst his policies as an "Obama jud<mark>g</mark>e," addin<mark>g</mark> "That's not law."[101] In October 2020, twenty Republican former U.S. attorneys, amon<mark>g</mark> them appointees by each Republican president since Eisenhower, characterized Trump as "a threat to the rule of law in our country." Gre<mark>g</mark> Brower, who worked in the Trump administration, asserted, "It's clear that President Trump views the Justice Department and the FBI as his own personal law firm and investi<mark>g</mark>ative a<mark>g</mark>ency."[102]

Early into his presidency, Trump developed a hi<mark>g</mark>hly contentious relationship with the news media, repeatedly referrin<mark>g</mark> to them as the "fake news media" and "the enemy of the people."[103] As a candidate, Trump had refused press credentials for offendin<mark>g</mark> publications but said he would not do so if elected.[104] Trump both privately and publicly mused about takin<mark>g</mark> away critical reporters' White House press credentials.[105] At the same time, the Trump White House <mark>g</mark>ave temporary press passes to far-ri<mark>g</mark>ht pro-Trump frin<mark>g</mark>e outlets, such as InfoWars and The Gateway Pundit, which are known for publishin<mark>g</mark> hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[105][106][107]

On his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understatin<mark>g</mark> the size of the crowd at his inau<mark>g</mark>uration and called the news media "amon<mark>g</mark> the most dishonest human bein<mark>g</mark>s on earth." Trump's claims were notably defended by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed the inau<mark>g</mark>uration crowd had been the bi<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>est in history, a claim disproven by photo<mark>g</mark>raphs.[108] Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway then defended Spicer when asked about the falsehood, sayin<mark>g</mark> it was an "alternative fact," not a falsehood.[109]

The relationship between Trump, the news media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a fake news website, "Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmin<mark>g</mark>ly pro-Trump" and "almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10% of people with the most conservative online information diets."[117][118] Brendan Nyhan, one of the authors of the study, said in an interview, "People <mark>g</mark>ot vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites."[119]

Three hurricanes hit the U.S. in Au<mark>g</mark>ust and September 2017: Harvey in southeastern Texas, Irma on the Florida Gulf coast, and Maria in Puerto Rico. Trump si<mark>g</mark>ned into law $15 billion in relief for Harvey and Irma, and later $18.67 billion for all three.[186] The administration came under criticism for its delayed response to the humanitarian crisis on Puerto Rico.[187] Politicians of both parties had called for immediate aid for Puerto Rico, and criticized Trump for focusin<mark>g</mark> on a feud with the National Football Lea<mark>g</mark>ue instead.[188] Trump did not comment on Puerto Rico for several days while the crisis was unfoldin<mark>g</mark>.[189] Accordin<mark>g</mark> to The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post, the White House did not feel a sense of ur<mark>g</mark>ency until "ima<mark>g</mark>es of the utter destruction and desperation – and criticism of the administration's response – be<mark>g</mark>an to appear on television."[190] Trump dismissed the criticism, sayin<mark>g</mark> distribution of necessary supplies was "doin<mark>g</mark> well". The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post noted, "on the <mark>g</mark>round in Puerto Rico, nothin<mark>g</mark> could be further from the truth."[190] Trump also criticized Puerto Rico officials.[191] A BMJ analysis found the federal <mark>g</mark>overnment responded much more quickly and on a lar<mark>g</mark>er scale to the hurricane in Texas and Florida than in Puerto Rico, despite the fact that the hurricane in Puerto Rico was more severe.[186] A 2021 HUD Inspector General investi<mark>g</mark>ation found that the Trump administration erected bureaucratic hurdles which stalled approximately $20 billion in hurricane relief for Puerto Rico.[192]

At the time of FEMA's departure from Puerto Rico, one third of Puerto Rico residents still lacked electricity and some places lacked runnin<mark>g</mark> water.[193] A New En<mark>g</mark>land Journal of Medicine study estimated the number of hurricane-related deaths durin<mark>g</mark> the period September 20 to December 31, 2017, to be around 4,600 (ran<mark>g</mark>e 793–8,498)[194] The official death rate due to Maria reported by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is 2,975; the fi<mark>g</mark>ure was based on an independent investi<mark>g</mark>ation by Geor<mark>g</mark>e Washin<mark>g</mark>ton University commissioned by the <mark>g</mark>overnor of Puerto Rico.[195] Trump falsely claimed the official death rate was wron<mark>g</mark>, and said the Democrats were tryin<mark>g</mark> to make him "look as bad as possible".[196]

Trump misleadin<mark>g</mark>ly blamed the destructive wildfires in 2018 in California, on "<mark>g</mark>ross" and "poor" "mismana<mark>g</mark>ement" of forests by California, sayin<mark>g</mark> there was no other reason for these wildfires. The fires in question were not "forest fires"; most of the forest was owned by federal a<mark>g</mark>encies; and climate chan<mark>g</mark>e in part contributed to the fires.[197]

In September 2017, Trump proposed the most sweepin<mark>g</mark> federal tax overhaul in many years.[225] Trump si<mark>g</mark>ned the tax le<mark>g</mark>islation on December 22, 2017, after it passed Con<mark>g</mark>ress on party-line votes.[226][227][228] The tax bill was the first major le<mark>g</mark>islation si<mark>g</mark>ned by Trump.[229] The $1.5 trillion bill reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%,[227] its lowest point since 1939.[228] The bill also cut the individual tax rate, reducin<mark>g</mark> the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, althou<mark>g</mark>h these individual tax cuts expire after 2025;[227] as a result, "by 2027, every income <mark>g</mark>roup makin<mark>g</mark> less than $75,000 would see a net tax increase."[229] The bill doubled the estate tax exemption (to $22 million for married couples); and allowed the owners of pass-throu<mark>g</mark>h businesses to deduct 20% of business income.[227] The bill doubled the standard deduction while eliminatin<mark>g</mark> many itemized deductions,[229] includin<mark>g</mark> the deduction for state and local taxes.[227] The bill also repeated the individual health insurance mandate contained in the Affordable Care Act.[229]

Trump si<mark>g</mark>ns the United States–Mexico–Canada A<mark>g</mark>reement (USMCA) alon<mark>g</mark>side Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Buenos Aires, Ar<mark>g</mark>entina, November 30, 2018.
In March 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washin<mark>g</mark> machines of 30–50%.[235] In March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) from most countries,[236][237] which covered an estimated 4.1% of U.S. imports.[238] On June 1, 2018, this was extended to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.[237] In separate moves, the Trump administration has set and escalated tariffs on <mark>g</mark>oods imported from China, leadin<mark>g</mark> to a trade war.[239] The tariffs an<mark>g</mark>ered tradin<mark>g</mark> partners, who implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. <mark>g</mark>oods,[240] and adversely affected real income and GDP.[241] A CNBC analysis found that Trump "enacted tariffs equivalent to one of the lar<mark>g</mark>est tax increases in decades", while Tax Foundation and Tax Policy Center analyses found the tariffs could wipe out the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for many households.[242][243] The two countries reached a "phase one" truce a<mark>g</mark>reement in January 2020. The bulk of the tariffs remained in place until talks were to resume after the 2020 election. Trump provided $28 billion in cash aid to farmers affected by the trade war.[244][245][246] Studies have found that the tariffs also adversely affected Republican candidates in elections.[247] An analysis published by The Wall Street Journal in October 2020 found the trade war did not achieve the primary objective of revivin<mark>g</mark> American manufacturin<mark>g</mark>, nor did it result in the reshorin<mark>g</mark> of factory production.[248]

Three weeks after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote an April 2019 Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled "Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies", statin<mark>g</mark> "Con<mark>g</mark>ress won't approve USMCA while constituents pay the price for Mexican and Canadian retaliation," Trump lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada.[249] Two weeks later, Trump unexpectedly announced he would impose a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico on June 10, increasin<mark>g</mark> to 10% on July 1, and by another 5% each month for three months, "until such time as ille<mark>g</mark>al mi<mark>g</mark>rants comin<mark>g</mark> throu<mark>g</mark>h Mexico, and into our Country, STOP".[250] Grassley commented the move as a "misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to con<mark>g</mark>ressional intent".[251] That same day, the Trump administration formally initiated the process to seek con<mark>g</mark>ressional approval of USMCA.[252] Trump's top trade advisor, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Li<mark>g</mark>hthizer, opposed the new Mexican tariffs on concerns it would jeopardize passa<mark>g</mark>e of USMCA.[253] Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump senior advisor Jared Kushner also opposed the action. Grassley, whose committee is instrumental in passin<mark>g</mark> USMCA, was not informed in advance of Trump's surprise announcement.[254] On June 7, Trump announced the tariffs would be "indefinitely suspended" after Mexico a<mark>g</mark>reed to take actions, includin<mark>g</mark> deployin<mark>g</mark> its National Guard throu<mark>g</mark>hout the country and alon<mark>g</mark> its southern border.[255] The New York Times reported the followin<mark>g</mark> day that Mexico had actually a<mark>g</mark>reed to most of the actions months earlier.[256]

As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump pled<mark>g</mark>ed to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade a<mark>g</mark>reement with eleven Pacific Rim nations which the United States had si<mark>g</mark>ned earlier that year. China was not a party to the a<mark>g</mark>reement, which was intended to allow the United States to <mark>g</mark>uide trade relations in the re<mark>g</mark>ion. He incorrectly asserted the deal was flawed because it contained a "back door" that would allow China to enter the a<mark>g</mark>reement later. Trump announced the American withdrawal from the deal days after takin<mark>g</mark> office. Upon the American withdrawal, the remainin<mark>g</mark> partners renamed it the Comprehensive and Pro<mark>g</mark>ressive A<mark>g</mark>reement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. In September 2021, China formally applied to join that a<mark>g</mark>reement in an effort to replace the United States as its hub; China's state-run Global Times said the move would "cement the country's leadership in <mark>g</mark>lobal trade" and leave the United States "increasin<mark>g</mark>ly isolated."[257][258]

Trump appointed Betsy DeVos as his Secretary of Education.

In 2017, Trump revoked an Obama administration memo which provided protections for people in default on student loans.[260] The United States Department of Education cancelled a<mark>g</mark>reements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to police student loan fraud.[261] The administration rescinded a re<mark>g</mark>ulation restrictin<mark>g</mark> federal fundin<mark>g</mark> to for-profit colle<mark>g</mark>es unable to demonstrate that colle<mark>g</mark>e <mark>g</mark>raduates had a reasonable debt-to-earnin<mark>g</mark>s ratio after enterin<mark>g</mark> the job market.[262] Seth Frotman, the CFPB student loan ombudsman, resi<mark>g</mark>ned, accusin<mark>g</mark> the Trump administration of underminin<mark>g</mark> the CFPB's work on protectin<mark>g</mark> student borrowers.[263] DeVos mar<mark>g</mark>inalized an investi<mark>g</mark>ative unit within the Department of Education that under Obama investi<mark>g</mark>ated predatory activities by for-profit colle<mark>g</mark>es.

In 2017, DeVos said the Obama administration's <mark>g</mark>uidance for how campuses address sexual assault "failed too many students" and she announced that she intended to replace the current approach "with a workable, effective and fair system".[265] Consequently, the administration scrapped an Obama administration <mark>g</mark>uidance on how schools and universities should combat sexual harassment and sexual violence.

Ener<mark>g</mark>y
Further information: Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump § Ener<mark>g</mark>y
The administration's "America First Ener<mark>g</mark>y Plan" did not mention renewable ener<mark>g</mark>y and instead focused on fossil fuels.[268] The administration enacted 30% tariffs on imported solar panels. The American solar ener<mark>g</mark>y industry is hi<mark>g</mark>hly reliant on forei<mark>g</mark>n parts (80% of parts are made abroad); as a result, the tariffs could raise the costs of solar ener<mark>g</mark>y, reduce innovation and reduce jobs in the industry – which in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry.[269][270] The administration reversed standards put in place to make commonly used li<mark>g</mark>htbulbs more ener<mark>g</mark>y-efficient.[271]

In January 2018, the administration sin<mark>g</mark>led out Florida for exemption from the administration's offshore drillin<mark>g</mark> plan. The move stirred controversy because it came after Florida Governor Rick Scott, who was considerin<mark>g</mark> a 2018 Senate run, complained about the plan. The move raised ethical questions about the appearance of "transactional favoritism" because Trump owns a coastal resort in Florida, and because of the state's status as a crucial "swin<mark>g</mark> state" in the 2020 presidential election.[278] Other states sou<mark>g</mark>ht similar offshore drillin<mark>g</mark> exemptions,[279] and liti<mark>g</mark>ation ensued.[280][281]

Con<mark>g</mark>ressional Republicans made two serious efforts to repeal the ACA. First, in March 2017, Trump endorsed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA.[349] Opposition from several House Republicans, both moderate and conservative, led to the defeat of this version of the bill.[349] Second in May 2017, the House narrowly voted in favor of a new version of the AHCA to repeal the ACA, sendin<mark>g</mark> the bill to the Senate for deliberation.[349] Over the next weeks the Senate made several attempts to create a repeal bill; however, all the proposals were ultimately rejected in a series of Senate votes in late July.[349] The individual mandate was repealed in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Kellyanne Conway led White House efforts to combat the opioid epidemic; Conway had no experience or expertise on matters of public health, substance abuse, or law enforcement.[378] Conway sidelined dru<mark>g</mark> experts and opted instead for the use of political staff. Politico wrote in 2018 that the administration's "main response" to the opioid crisis "so far has been to call for a border wall and to promise a 'just say no' campai<mark>g</mark>n".[378]

Secretary of Housin<mark>g</mark> and Urban Development Ben Carson, first day on the job
In December 2017, The Economist described the Department of Housin<mark>g</mark> and Urban Development (HUD), led by Carson, as "directionless". Most of the top HUD positions were unfilled and Carson's leadership was "inconspicuous and inscrutable". Of the policies HUD was enactin<mark>g</mark>, The Economist wrote, "it is hard not to conclude that the <mark>g</mark>overnin<mark>g</mark> principle at HUD is to take whatever the Obama administration was doin<mark>g</mark>, and do the opposite."[418] HUD scaled back the enforcement of fair housin<mark>g</mark> laws, halted several fair housin<mark>g</mark> investi<mark>g</mark>ations started by the Obama administration and removed the words "inclusive" and "free from discrimination" from its mission statement.[419] The administration desi<mark>g</mark>nated Lynne Patton, an event planner who had worked on the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n and planned Eric Trump's weddin<mark>g</mark>, to lead HUD's New York and New Jersey office (which oversees billions of federal dollars).[420]

Trump has repeatedly characterized ille<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>rants as criminals, althou<mark>g</mark>h some studies have found they have lower crime and incarceration rates than native-born Americans.[421] Prior to takin<mark>g</mark> office, Trump promised to deport the estimated eleven million ille<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>rants livin<mark>g</mark> in the United States and to build a wall alon<mark>g</mark> the Mexico–U.S. border.[422] Durin<mark>g</mark> his presidency, Trump reduced le<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>ration substantially while the ille<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>rant population remained the same.[423] The administration took several steps to limit the ri<mark>g</mark>hts of le<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>rants, which included attempted revocations of Temporary Protected Status for Central American refu<mark>g</mark>ees,[424] 60,000 Haitians (who emi<mark>g</mark>rated followin<mark>g</mark> the 2010 Haiti earthquake),[425] and 200,000 Salvadorans (who emi<mark>g</mark>rated followin<mark>g</mark> a series of devastatin<mark>g</mark> earthquakes in 2001)[426] as well as makin<mark>g</mark> it ille<mark>g</mark>al for refu<mark>g</mark>ees and asylum seekers,[427] and spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the U.S.[428] A federal jud<mark>g</mark>e blocked the administration's attempt to deport the TPS recipients, citin<mark>g</mark> what the jud<mark>g</mark>e said was Trump's racial "animus a<mark>g</mark>ainst non-white, non-European immi<mark>g</mark>rants".[429] The administration slashed refu<mark>g</mark>ee admissions to record low levels (since the modern pro<mark>g</mark>ram be<mark>g</mark>an in 1980).[430] The administration made it harder non-citizens who served in the military to receive necessary paperwork to pursue U.S. citizenship.[431] The administration's key le<mark>g</mark>islative proposal on immi<mark>g</mark>ration was the 2017 RAISE Act, a proposal to reduce le<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>ration levels to the U.S. by fifty percent by halvin<mark>g</mark> the number of <mark>g</mark>reen cards issued, cappin<mark>g</mark> refu<mark>g</mark>ee admissions at 50,000 a year and endin<mark>g</mark> the visa diversity lottery.[432] In 2020, the Trump administration set the lowest cap for refu<mark>g</mark>ees in the modern history of the United States for the subsequent year: 15,000 refu<mark>g</mark>ees.[433] The administration increased fees for citizen applications, as well as caused delays in the processin<mark>g</mark> of citizen applications.[434]

By February 2018, arrests of undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants by ICE increased by forty percent durin<mark>g</mark> Trump's tenure. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants were twice as hi<mark>g</mark>h as durin<mark>g</mark> Obama's final year in office. Arrests of undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants with criminal convictions increased only sli<mark>g</mark>htly.[435] In 2018, experts noted that the Trump administration's immi<mark>g</mark>ration policies had led to an increase in criminality and lawlessness alon<mark>g</mark> the U.S.–Mexico border, as asylum seekers prevented by U.S. authorities from filin<mark>g</mark> for asylum had been preyed upon by human smu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>lers, or<mark>g</mark>anized crime and corrupt local law enforcement.[436] To defend administration policies on immi<mark>g</mark>ration, the administration fud<mark>g</mark>ed data and presented intentionally misleadin<mark>g</mark> analyses of the costs associated with refu<mark>g</mark>ees (omittin<mark>g</mark> data that showed net positive fiscal effects),[437] as well as created the Victims of Immi<mark>g</mark>ration Crime En<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>ement to hi<mark>g</mark>hli<mark>g</mark>ht crimes committed by undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants (there is no evidence undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants increase the U.S. crime rate).[438] In January 2018, Trump was widely criticized after referrin<mark>g</mark> to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations in <mark>g</mark>eneral as "shithole countries" at a bipartisan meetin<mark>g</mark> on immi<mark>g</mark>ration. Multiple international leaders condemned his remarks as racist.[439]

Multiple international leaders condemned his remarks as racist.[439]
Upon takin<mark>g</mark> office, Trump directed the DHS to be<mark>g</mark>in work on a wall.[440] An internal DHS report estimated Trump's wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3.5 years to build (far hi<mark>g</mark>her than the Trump 2016 campai<mark>g</mark>n's estimate ($12 billion) and the $15 billion estimate from Republican con<mark>g</mark>ressional leaders).[441] In a January 2017 phone call between Trump and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump conceded that the U.S. would pay for the border wall, not Mexico as he promised durin<mark>g</mark> the campai<mark>g</mark>n, and implored Nieto to stop sayin<mark>g</mark> publicly the Mexican <mark>g</mark>overnment would not pay for the border wall.[442] In January 2018, the administration proposed spendin<mark>g</mark> $18 billion over the next ten years on the wall, more than half of the $33 billion spendin<mark>g</mark> blueprint for border security.[443] Trump's plan would reduce fundin<mark>g</mark> for border surveillance, radar technolo<mark>g</mark>y, patrol boats and customs a<mark>g</mark>ents; experts and officials say these are more effective at curbin<mark>g</mark> ille<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>ration and preventin<mark>g</mark> terrorism and smu<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>lin<mark>g</mark> than a border wall.[443]

The administration sou<mark>g</mark>ht to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which experts warned would likely result in severe undercountin<mark>g</mark> of the population and faulty data,[444] with naturalized U.S. citizens, le<mark>g</mark>al immi<mark>g</mark>rants, and undocumented immi<mark>g</mark>rants all bein<mark>g</mark> less likely to respond to the census.[445] Blue states were estimated to <mark>g</mark>et fewer con<mark>g</mark>ressional seats and lower con<mark>g</mark>ressional appropriations than they would otherwise <mark>g</mark>et, because they have lar<mark>g</mark>er non-citizen populations.[446] Thomas B. Hofeller, an architect of Republican <mark>g</mark>errymanderin<mark>g</mark>, had found addin<mark>g</mark> the census question would help to <mark>g</mark>errymander maps that "would be advanta<mark>g</mark>eous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites" and that Hofeller had later written the key portion of a letter from the Trump administration's Justice Department justifyin<mark>g</mark> the addition of a citizenship question by claimin<mark>g</mark> it was needed to enforce the 1965 Votin<mark>g</mark> Ri<mark>g</mark>hts Act.[447] In July 2019, the Supreme Court in Department of Commerce v.

Durin<mark>g</mark> the 2018 mid-term election campai<mark>g</mark>n, Trump sent nearly 5,600 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border for the stated purpose of protectin<mark>g</mark> the United States a<mark>g</mark>ainst a caravan of Central American mi<mark>g</mark>rants.[449] The Penta<mark>g</mark>on had previously concluded the caravan posed no threat to the U.S. The border deployment was estimated to cost as much as $220 million by the end of the year.[450] With daily warnin<mark>g</mark>s from Trump about the dan<mark>g</mark>ers of the caravan durin<mark>g</mark> the mid-term election campai<mark>g</mark>n, the frequency and intensity of the caravan rhetoric nearly stopped after election day.[451]

In May 2018, the administration announced it would separate children from parents cau<mark>g</mark>ht unlawfully crossin<mark>g</mark> the southern border into the United States. Parents were routinely char<mark>g</mark>ed with a misdemeanor and jailed; their children were placed in separate detention centers with no established procedure to track them or reunite them with their parent after they had served time for their offence, <mark>g</mark>enerally only a few hours or days.[452] Later that month, Trump falsely accused Democrats of creatin<mark>g</mark> that policy, despite it ori<mark>g</mark>inatin<mark>g</mark> from his own administration, and ur<mark>g</mark>ed Con<mark>g</mark>ress to "<mark>g</mark>et to<mark>g</mark>ether" and pass an immi<mark>g</mark>ration bill.[453] Members of Con<mark>g</mark>ress from both parties condemned the practice and pointed out that the White House could end the separations on its own.[454] The Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Post quoted a White House official as sayin<mark>g</mark> Trump's decision to separate mi<mark>g</mark>rant families was to <mark>g</mark>ain political levera<mark>g</mark>e to force Democrats and moderate Republicans to accept hardline immi<mark>g</mark>ration le<mark>g</mark>islation.[455]

Six weeks into the implementation of the "zero tolerance" policy, at least 2,300 mi<mark>g</mark>rant children had been separated from their families.[456] The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Colle<mark>g</mark>e of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association condemned the policy, with the American Academy of Pediatrics sayin<mark>g</mark> the policy was causin<mark>g</mark> "irreparable harm" to the children.[457][455] The policy was extremely unpopular, more so than any major piece of le<mark>g</mark>islation in recent memory.[458] Videos and ima<mark>g</mark>es of children held in ca<mark>g</mark>e-like detention centers, distrau<mark>g</mark>ht parents separated from their children, and sobbin<mark>g</mark> children caused an outcry.[456] After criticism, DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen falsely claimed that "We do not have a policy of separatin<mark>g</mark> families at the border."[459]

On June 20, 2018, amid worldwide outra<mark>g</mark>e and enormous political pressure to roll back his policy, Trump reversed the family-separation policy by si<mark>g</mark>nin<mark>g</mark> an executive order,[456] despite earlier havin<mark>g</mark> said "you can't do it throu<mark>g</mark>h an executive order."[456] Six days later, as the result of a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, U.S. District Jud<mark>g</mark>e Dana Sabraw issued a nationwide preliminary injunction a<mark>g</mark>ainst the family-separation policy, and required the <mark>g</mark>overnment to reunite separated families within 30 days.[460] By November 2020, the parents of 666 children still had not been found.[461] The administration has refused to provide funds to cover the expenses of reunitin<mark>g</mark> families, and volunteer or<mark>g</mark>anizations continue to provide both volunteers and fundin<mark>g</mark>.[462][463][464] The administration also refused to pay for mental health services for the families and orphaned children traumatized by the separations.[465]

Trump si<mark>g</mark>ns Executive Order 13769 at the Penta<mark>g</mark>on. Vice President Mike Pence (left) and Secretary of Defense James Mattis look on, January 27, 2017.
In January 2017, Trump si<mark>g</mark>ned an executive order which indefinitely suspended admission of asylum seekers fleein<mark>g</mark> the Syrian Civil War, suspended admission of all other refu<mark>g</mark>ees for 120 days, and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The order also established a reli<mark>g</mark>ious test for refu<mark>g</mark>ees from Muslim nations by <mark>g</mark>ivin<mark>g</mark> priority to refu<mark>g</mark>ees of other reli<mark>g</mark>ions over Muslim refu<mark>g</mark>ees.[466] Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exemptin<mark>g</mark> visitors with a <mark>g</mark>reen card.[467] After the order was challen<mark>g</mark>ed in the federal courts, several federal jud<mark>g</mark>es issued rulin<mark>g</mark>s enjoinin<mark>g</mark> the <mark>g</mark>overnment from enforcin<mark>g</mark> the order.[467] Trump fired actin<mark>g</mark> Attorney General Sally Yates after she said she would not defend the order in court; Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, who said the Department of Justice would defend the order.[468]

A new executive order was si<mark>g</mark>ned in March which limited travel to the U.S. from six different countries for 90 days, and by all refu<mark>g</mark>ees who do not possess either a visa or valid travel documents for 120 days.[469] The new executive order revoked and replaced the executive order issued in January.[470]

In June, the Supreme Court partially stayed certain injunctions that were put on the order by two federal appeals courts earlier, allowin<mark>g</mark> the executive order to mostly <mark>g</mark>o into effect. In October, the Court dismissed the case, sayin<mark>g</mark> the orders had been replaced by a new proclamation, so challen<mark>g</mark>es to the previous executive orders are moot.[471]

In September, Trump si<mark>g</mark>ned a proclamation placin<mark>g</mark> limits on the six countries in the second executive order and added Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela.[472] In October 2017, Jud<mark>g</mark>e Derrick Watson, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii issued another temporary restrainin<mark>g</mark> order.[473] In December 2017, the Supreme Court allowed the September 2017 travel restrictions to <mark>g</mark>o into effect while le<mark>g</mark>al challen<mark>g</mark>es in Hawaii and Maryland are heard.

2018–2019 federal <mark>g</mark>overnment shutdown
Main article: 2018–2019 United States federal <mark>g</mark>overnment shutdown
The federal <mark>g</mark>overnment was partially shut down from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, (the lon<mark>g</mark>est shutdown in U.S. history) over Trump's demand that Con<mark>g</mark>ress provide $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.[479] The House and Senate lacked votes necessary to support his fundin<mark>g</mark> demand and to overcome Trump's refusal to si<mark>g</mark>n the appropriations last passed by Con<mark>g</mark>ress into law.[480] In ne<mark>g</mark>otiations with Democratic leaders leadin<mark>g</mark> up to the shutdown, Trump commented he would be "proud to shut down the <mark>g</mark>overnment for border security".[481] By mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP by 0.1 percenta<mark>g</mark>e points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.[482]

In September 2020, Brian Murphy – who until Au<mark>g</mark>ust 2020 was the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence and Analysis – asserted in a whistleblower complaint[483] that durin<mark>g</mark> the shutdown senior DHS officials sou<mark>g</mark>ht to inflate the number of known or suspected terrorists who had been apprehended at the border, to increase support for fundin<mark>g</mark> the wall. NBC News reported that in early 2019 a DHS spokeswoman, Katie Waldman, pushed the network to retract a story that correctly cited only six such apprehensions in the first half of 2018, compared to the nearly four thousand a year the administration was publicly claimin<mark>g</mark>. The story was not retracted, and Waldman later became the press secretary for Vice President Pence and wife of Trump advisor Stephen Miller.[484][485]

The administration mar<mark>g</mark>inalized the role of science in policymakin<mark>g</mark>, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was mar<mark>g</mark>inalized or suppressed.[313] In 2018, 19 months after Trump took office, meteorolo<mark>g</mark>ist Kelvin Droe<mark>g</mark>emeier became the Science Advisor to the President; this was the lon<mark>g</mark>est period without a science advisor since the 1976 administration.[533] While preparin<mark>g</mark> for talks with Kim Jon<mark>g</mark>-un, the White House did not do so with the assistance of a White House science adviser or senior counselor trained in nuclear physics. The position of chief scientist in the State Department or the Department of A<mark>g</mark>riculture was not filled. The administration nominated Sam Clovis to be chief scientist in the U.S. Department of A<mark>g</mark>riculture, but he had no scientific back<mark>g</mark>round and the White House later withdrew the nomination. The administration successfully nominated Jim Bridenstine, who had no back<mark>g</mark>round in science and rejected the scientific consensus on climate chan<mark>g</mark>e, to lead NASA. The U.S. Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Food and Dru<mark>g</mark> Administration (FDA) disbanded advisory committees,[534] while the Department of Ener<mark>g</mark>y prohibited use of the term "climate chan<mark>g</mark>e".[535][536] In March 2020, The New York Times reported that an official at the Interior Department has repeatedly inserted climate chan<mark>g</mark>e-denyin<mark>g</mark> lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e into the a<mark>g</mark>ency's scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral ri<mark>g</mark>hts.[537]

Trump has repeatedly alle<mark>g</mark>ed, without evidence, there was widespread voter fraud.[551] The administration created a commission with the stated purpose to review the extent of voter fraud in the wake of Trump's false claim that millions of unauthorized votes cost him the popular vote in the 2016 election. It was chaired by Vice President Pence, while the day-to-day administrator was Kris Kobach, best known for promotin<mark>g</mark> restrictions on access to votin<mark>g</mark>. The commission be<mark>g</mark>an its work by requestin<mark>g</mark> each state to turn over detailed information about all re<mark>g</mark>istered voters in their database. Most states rejected the request, citin<mark>g</mark> privacy concerns or state laws.[552] Multiple lawsuits were filed a<mark>g</mark>ainst the commission. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said Kobach was refusin<mark>g</mark> to share workin<mark>g</mark> documents and schedulin<mark>g</mark> information with him and the other Democrats on the commission. A federal jud<mark>g</mark>e ordered the commission to hand over the documents.[553] Shortly thereafter, Trump disbanded the commission, and informed Dunlap that it would not obey the court order to provide the documents because the commission no lon<mark>g</mark>er existed.[554] Election inte<mark>g</mark>rity experts ar<mark>g</mark>ued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to <mark>g</mark>reater transparency and accountability and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producin<mark>g</mark> a sham report to justify restrictions on votin<mark>g</mark> ri<mark>g</mark>hts.[553] It was later revealed the commission had, in its requests for Texas voter data, specifically asked for data that identifies voters with Hispanic surnames.[555]

As a candidate and as president, Trump called for a major build-up of American military capabilities. Trump announced in October 2018 that the United States would withdraw from the Intermediate-Ran<mark>g</mark>e Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. The <mark>g</mark>oal was to enable the United States to counter increasin<mark>g</mark> Chinese intermediate nuclear missile capabilities in the Pacific.[579] In December 2018, Trump complained about the amount the United States spends on an "uncontrollable arms race" with Russia and China. Trump said that the $716 billion which the United States was spendin<mark>g</mark> on the "arms race" was "Crazy!". He had previously praised his own increased defense spendin<mark>g</mark>, five months earlier. The total fiscal 2019 defense bud<mark>g</mark>et authorization was $716 billion, althou<mark>g</mark>h missile defense and nuclear pro<mark>g</mark>rams made up about $10 billion of the total.[580][581]

Controversy arose in November 2019 after Trump pardoned or promoted three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes.[583] The most prominent case involved Eddie Galla<mark>g</mark>her, a Navy SEAL team chief who had been reported to Navy authorities by his own team members for snipin<mark>g</mark> at an unarmed civilian <mark>g</mark>irl and an elderly man. Galla<mark>g</mark>her faced court martial for the murder of a wounded teena<mark>g</mark>e combatant, amon<mark>g</mark> other char<mark>g</mark>es. The medic of his SEAL team was <mark>g</mark>ranted immunity to testify a<mark>g</mark>ainst him, but on the witness stand the medic reversed what he had previously told investi<mark>g</mark>ators and testified that he himself had murdered the teena<mark>g</mark>e combatant. Galla<mark>g</mark>her was subsequently acquitted of the murder char<mark>g</mark>e a<mark>g</mark>ainst him, and the Navy demoted him to the lowest possible rank due to his conviction on another char<mark>g</mark>e. The Navy later moved to strip Galla<mark>g</mark>her of his Trident pin and to eject him from the Navy. Trump intervened to restore Galla<mark>g</mark>her's rank and pin. Many military officers were enra<mark>g</mark>ed by Trump's intervention, as they felt it disrupted principles of military discipline and justice. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer protested Trump's intervention and was forced to resi<mark>g</mark>n; in his resi<mark>g</mark>nation letter, he sharply rebuked Trump for his jud<mark>g</mark>ment in the matter.

With the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the state of relations between the United States and Cuba was unclear as of January 2017.

On 16 June 2017, President Trump announced that he was suspendin<mark>g</mark> what he called a "completely one-sided deal with Cuba". Trump characterized Obama's policy as havin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>ranted Cuba economic sanctions relief for nothin<mark>g</mark> in return. Since then, the administration's new policy has aimed to impose new restrictions with re<mark>g</mark>ards to travel and fundin<mark>g</mark>; however, travelin<mark>g</mark> via airlines and cruise lines has not been prohibited completely. Moreover, diplomatic relations remain intact and embassies in Washin<mark>g</mark>ton D.C. and Havana stay open.[603][604][605]

After initially adoptin<mark>g</mark> a verbally hostile posture[609] toward North Korea and its leader, Kim Jon<mark>g</mark>-un, Trump quickly pivoted to embrace the re<mark>g</mark>ime, sayin<mark>g</mark> he and Kim "fell in love".[610] Trump en<mark>g</mark>a<mark>g</mark>ed Kim by meetin<mark>g</mark> him at two summits, in June 2018 and February 2019, an unprecedented move by an American president, as previous policy had been that a president's simply meetin<mark>g</mark> with the North Korean leader would le<mark>g</mark>itimize the re<mark>g</mark>ime on the world sta<mark>g</mark>e. Durin<mark>g</mark> the June 2018 summit, the leaders si<mark>g</mark>ned a va<mark>g</mark>ue a<mark>g</mark>reement to pursue denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, with Trump immediately declarin<mark>g</mark> "There is no lon<mark>g</mark>er a Nuclear Threat from North Korea."[611] Little pro<mark>g</mark>ress was made toward that <mark>g</mark>oal durin<mark>g</mark> the months before the February 2019 summit, which ended abruptly without an a<mark>g</mark>reement, hours after the White House announced a si<mark>g</mark>nin<mark>g</mark> ceremony was imminent.[612] Durin<mark>g</mark> the months between the summits, a <mark>g</mark>rowin<mark>g</mark> body of evidence indicated North Korea was continuin<mark>g</mark> its nuclear fuel, bomb and missile development, includin<mark>g</mark> by redevelopin<mark>g</mark> an ICBM site it was previously appearin<mark>g</mark> to dismantle – even while the second summit was underway.[613][614][615][616] In the aftermath of the February 2019 failed summit, the Treasury department imposed additional sanctions on North Korea.

In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the White House acknowled<mark>g</mark>ed that Turkey would be carryin<mark>g</mark> out a planned military offensive into northern Syria; as such, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area to avoid interference with that operation. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fi<mark>g</mark>hters to Turkey.[624] Con<mark>g</mark>ress members of both parties denounced the move, includin<mark>g</mark> Republican allies of Trump like Senator Lindsey Graham. They ar<mark>g</mark>ued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would benefit ISIS, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian re<mark>g</mark>ime.[625] Trump defended the move, citin<mark>g</mark> the hi<mark>g</mark>h cost of supportin<mark>g</mark> the Kurds, and the lack of support from the Kurds in past U.S. wars.[626] Within a week of the U.S. pullout, Turkey proceeded to attack Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria.[627] Kurdish forces then announced an alliance with the Syrian <mark>g</mark>overnment and its Russian allies, in a united effort to repel Turkey.[628]

Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen a<mark>g</mark>ainst the Houthis.[631][632][633] Trump also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[631] On May 20, 2017, Trump and Saudi Arabia's Kin<mark>g</mark> Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud si<mark>g</mark>ned a series of letters of intent for the Kin<mark>g</mark>dom of Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totalin<mark>g</mark> $110 billion immediately,[634][635] and $350 billion over ten years.[636][637] The transfer was widely seen as a counterbalance a<mark>g</mark>ainst the influence of Iran in the re<mark>g</mark>ion[638][639] and a "si<mark>g</mark>nificant" and "historic" expansion of United States relations with Saudi Arabia.[640][641][642][636][643] By July 2019, two of Trump's three vetoes were to overturn bipartisan con<mark>g</mark>ressional action related to Saudi Arabia.[644]

In February 2018, when Mueller indicted more than a dozen Russians and three entities for interference in the 2016 election, Trump asserted the indictment was proof his campai<mark>g</mark>n did not collude with the Russians.

On March 22, 2019, Mueller submitted the final report to Attorney General William Barr. Two days later, Barr sent Con<mark>g</mark>ress a four-pa<mark>g</mark>e letter, describin<mark>g</mark> what he said were the special counsel's principal conclusions in the report. Barr added that, since the special counsel "did not draw a conclusion" on obstruction,[685] this "leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime".[686] Barr continued: "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed durin<mark>g</mark> the Special Counsel's investi<mark>g</mark>ation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."[687][688]

Trump and dispara<mark>g</mark>ed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton",[694] and to "provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States".[695] The report also described how the Russian intelli<mark>g</mark>ence service, the GRU, performed computer hackin<mark>g</mark> and strate<mark>g</mark>ic releasin<mark>g</mark> of dama<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> material from the Clinton campai<mark>g</mark>n and Democratic Party or<mark>g</mark>anizations.[696][697] To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n with re<mark>g</mark>ard to Russian interference, investi<mark>g</mark>ators used the le<mark>g</mark>al standard for criminal conspiracy rather than the popular concept of "collusion", because a crime of "collusion" is not found in criminal law or the United States Code.[698][699]

Accordin<mark>g</mark> to the report, the investi<mark>g</mark>ation "identified numerous links between the Russian <mark>g</mark>overnment and the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n", and found that Russia had "perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency" and the 2016 Trump presidential campai<mark>g</mark>n "expected it would benefit electorally" from Russian hackin<mark>g</mark> efforts. Ultimately, "the investi<mark>g</mark>ation did not establish that members of the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n conspired or coordinated with the Russian <mark>g</mark>overnment in its election interference activities."[700][701] However, investi<mark>g</mark>ators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred durin<mark>g</mark> the 2016 campai<mark>g</mark>n, due to some associates of the Trump campai<mark>g</mark>n providin<mark>g</mark> false or incomplete testimony, exercisin<mark>g</mark> the privile<mark>g</mark>e a<mark>g</mark>ainst self-incrimination, and havin<mark>g</mark> deleted, unsaved, or encrypted communications.

Volume II covered obstruction of justice. The report described ten episodes where Trump may have obstructed justice as president, plus one instance before he was elected.[703][704] The report said that in addition to Trump's public attacks on the investi<mark>g</mark>ation and its subjects, he had also privately tried to "control the investi<mark>g</mark>ation" in multiple ways, but mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions.[705][706] For that reason, no char<mark>g</mark>es a<mark>g</mark>ainst the Trump's aides and associates were recommended "beyond those already filed".[703] The special counsel could not char<mark>g</mark>e Trump himself once investi<mark>g</mark>ators decided to abide by an Office of Le<mark>g</mark>al Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sittin<mark>g</mark> president cannot stand trial,[707][708] and they feared char<mark>g</mark>es would affect Trump's <mark>g</mark>overnin<mark>g</mark> and possibly preempt his impeachment.[708][709] In addition, investi<mark>g</mark>ators felt it would be unfair to accuse Trump of a crime without char<mark>g</mark>es and without a trial in which he could clear his name,[707][708][705] hence investi<mark>g</mark>ators "determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a jud<mark>g</mark>ment that the President committed crimes".[708][710][711][712]

Since the special counsel's office had decided "not to make a traditional prosecutorial jud<mark>g</mark>ment" on whether to "initiate or decline a prosecution", they "did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct". The report "does not conclude that the president committed a crime",[694][713] but specifically did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, because investi<mark>g</mark>ators were not confident that Trump was innocent after examinin<mark>g</mark> his intent and actions.[714][715] The report concluded "that Con<mark>g</mark>ress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the inte<mark>g</mark>rity of the administration of justice" and "that Con<mark>g</mark>ress may apply the obstruction laws to the president's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law".[711][715][705]

In the lead up to his inau<mark>g</mark>uration, Trump promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses.[747] Trump placed his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. at the head of his businesses claimin<mark>g</mark> they would not communicate with him re<mark>g</mark>ardin<mark>g</mark> his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from havin<mark>g</mark> input into his businesses and knowin<mark>g</mark> how to benefit himself, and Trump continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses.[748] As his presidency pro<mark>g</mark>ressed, he failed to take steps or show interest in further distancin<mark>g</mark> himself from his business interests resultin<mark>g</mark> in numerous potential conflicts.[749] Ethics experts found Trump's plan to address conflicts of interest between his position as president and his private business interests to be entirely inadequate.[750] Unlike every other president in the last 40 years, Trump did not put his business interests in a blind trust or equivalent arran<mark>g</mark>ement "to cleanly sever himself from his business interests".[750] In January 2018, a year into his presidency, Trump owned stakes in hundreds of businesses.[751]

On Au<mark>g</mark>ust 12, 2019, an unnamed intelli<mark>g</mark>ence official privately filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA).[791] The whistleblower alle<mark>g</mark>ed that Trump had abused his office in solicitin<mark>g</mark> forei<mark>g</mark>n interference to improve his own electoral chances in 2020. The complaint reports that in a July 2019 call, Trump had asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investi<mark>g</mark>ate potential 2020 rival presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as matters pertainin<mark>g</mark> to whether Russian interference occurred in the 2016 U.S. election with re<mark>g</mark>ard to Democratic National Committee servers and the company Crowdstrike. Trump alle<mark>g</mark>edly nominated his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to work with Ukraine on these matters. Additionally, the whistleblower alle<mark>g</mark>ed that the White House attempted to "lock down" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campai<mark>g</mark>n by Giuliani and the Trump administration to ur<mark>g</mark>e Ukraine to investi<mark>g</mark>ate the Bidens. The whistleblower posits that the pressure campai<mark>g</mark>n may have included Trump cancellin<mark>g</mark> Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholdin<mark>g</mark> financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.[792][793][794][795]

The whistleblower posits that the pressure campai<mark>g</mark>n may have included Trump cancellin<mark>g</mark> Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholdin<mark>g</mark> financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.[792][793][794][795]
Inspector General Atkinson found the whistleblower's complaint both ur<mark>g</mark>ent and credible, so he transmitted the complaint on Au<mark>g</mark>ust 26 to Joseph Ma<mark>g</mark>uire, the actin<mark>g</mark> Director of National Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence (DNI). Under the law, Ma<mark>g</mark>uire was supposed to forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence Committees within a week. Ma<mark>g</mark>uire refused, so Atkinson informed the con<mark>g</mark>ressional committees of the existence of the complaint, but not its content.[796][797] The <mark>g</mark>eneral counsel for Ma<mark>g</mark>uire's office said that since the complaint was not about someone in the intelli<mark>g</mark>ence community, it was not an "ur<mark>g</mark>ent concern" and thus there was no need to pass it to Con<mark>g</mark>ress. Later testifyin<mark>g</mark> before the House Intelli<mark>g</mark>ence Committee on September 26, Ma<mark>g</mark>uire said he had consulted with the White House Counsel and the Justice Department's Office of Le<mark>g</mark>al Counsel, of which the latter office <mark>g</mark>ave him the rationale to withhold the complaint.[798] Ma<mark>g</mark>uire also testified: "I think the whistleblower did the ri<mark>g</mark>ht thin<mark>g</mark>. I think he followed the law every step of the way."[799]

Open hearin<mark>g</mark> testimony of Fiona Hill and David Holmes on November 21, 2019
On September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry.[802] On September 25, the White House released a non-verbatim transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky; while the members and staff of con<mark>g</mark>ressional intelli<mark>g</mark>ence committees were allowed to read whistleblower complaint.[797] On September 26, the White House declassified the whistleblower's complaint, so Schiff released the complaint to the public.[797] The non-verbatim transcript corroborated the main alle<mark>g</mark>ations of the whistleblower's report about the Trump–Zelensky call.[803] The non-verbatim transcript stated that after Zelensky discussed the possibility of buyin<mark>g</mark> American anti-tank missiles to defend Ukraine, Trump instead asked for a favor, su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>estin<mark>g</mark> an investi<mark>g</mark>ation of the company Crowdstrike, while later in the call he also called for an investi<mark>g</mark>ation of the Bidens, and cooperation with Giuliani and Barr.[804][805] On September 27, the White House confirmed the whistleblower's alle<mark>g</mark>ation that the Trump administration had stored the Trump–Zelensky transcript in a hi<mark>g</mark>hly classified system.[806]

 Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: In evaluatin<mark>g</mark> whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of "collusion". In so doin<mark>g</mark>, the Office reco<mark>g</mark>nized that the word "collud[e]" was used in communications with the Actin<mark>g</mark> Attorney General confirmin<mark>g</mark> certain aspects of the investi<mark>g</mark>ation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reportin<mark>g</mark> about the investi<mark>g</mark>ation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzin<mark>g</mark> questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.

This list includes defunct and extant monarchical dynasties of soverei<mark>g</mark>n, non-soverei<mark>g</mark>n, national, and subnational statuses.

While most dynasties were/are reckoned throu<mark>g</mark>h the male line, the relatively uncommon cases of dynasties formed throu<mark>g</mark>h matrilineal succession, such as the Rain Queen dynasty, are also listed.

Althou<mark>g</mark>h thrones could theoretically be rotated amon<mark>g</mark> several families in elective monarchies, some entities consistently elected/elect their rulers from the same family, effectively functionin<mark>g</mark> as hereditary monarchies controlled by dynasties. For example, the Holy Roman Empire was de jure an elective monarchy, but came under the de facto hereditary rule of the House of Habsbur<mark>g</mark> from AD 1440 to AD 1740, and is therefore listed as such in the "Germany" section.

This list also includes monarchical re<mark>g</mark>imes whose rulin<mark>g</mark> houses became extinct or were removed from power after havin<mark>g</mark> only one monarch, but would otherwise have been dynastic in their throne successions. For instance, whereas the Thonburi Kin<mark>g</mark>dom had only one ruler, it would likely have produced a series of monarchs from the same rulin<mark>g</mark> clan had the throne not been usurped by the Chakri dynasty; the Thonburi Kin<mark>g</mark>dom is thus included under the "Thailand (Siam)" section.

Where possible, descendants of overthrown dynasties and pretenders are also listed. For instance, the House of Planta<mark>g</mark>enet laid claim to the throne of the Kin<mark>g</mark>dom of Sicily between AD 1254 and AD 1263, and is thus listed under the "Italy" section. Likewise, the Osmanoğlu family is descended from the Ottoman dynasty, and is therefore included in the "Anatolia (Asia Minor)" section.

Entries in each section are sorted by the start year and end year of their rule, irrespective of the exact dates. Dynasties with unverifiable or disputed periods of rule are listed after those with rei<mark>g</mark>n periods that are <mark>g</mark>enerally a<mark>g</mark>reed upon by scholars. In cases wherein several dynasties are typically <mark>g</mark>rouped to<mark>g</mark>ether in conventional historio<mark>g</mark>raphy, such as the Northern and Southern dynasties of China, they are listed as such for ease of reference.

A dynasty may be known by more than one name, either due to differences between its official and historio<mark>g</mark>raphical denominations, and/or due to the existence of multiple official and/or historio<mark>g</mark>raphical names. For example, the Amorian dynasty is also referred to as the "Phry<mark>g</mark>ian dynasty".

Due to variations in romanization, the name of a dynasty may be rendered differently dependin<mark>g</mark> on the source. For instance, the Qin<mark>g</mark> dynasty is also written as "Ch῾in<mark>g</mark> dynasty" usin<mark>g</mark> the Wade–Giles romanization.

The year of establishment and/or the year of collapse of a dynasty may be unknown or remain contentious amon<mark>g</mark> scholars. In the latter cases, only an approximate time frame will be <mark>g</mark>iven. For example, the Deva dynasty is believed to have ruled durin<mark>g</mark> the 12th and 13th centuries AD, but the exact dates are disputed.

The year of establishment and/or the year of collapse of a dynasty could differ from its period of rule over a particular realm and/or <mark>g</mark>eo<mark>g</mark>raphic re<mark>g</mark>ion. In such cases, the year(s) provided indicate the period durin<mark>g</mark> which a dynasty was/is in power in a particular realm and/or <mark>g</mark>eo<mark>g</mark>raphic re<mark>g</mark>ion. For instance, whereas the House of Savoy was founded in AD 1003 in the County of Savoy and maintained its rule until AD 1946 in the Kin<mark>g</mark>dom of Italy, it briefly held the throne of Spain from AD 1870 to AD 1873, and is thus reflected as such in the "Spain" section.

For instance, whereas the House of Savoy was founded in AD 1003 in the County of Savoy and maintained its rule until AD 1946 in the Kin<mark>g</mark>dom of Italy, it briefly held the throne of Spain from AD 1870 to AD 1873, and is thus reflected as such in the "Spain" section.
This list is sorted by the territorial extent of dynasties. Listin<mark>g</mark> a particular dynasty under a specific section need not necessarily denote affiliation—political, ethnic, reli<mark>g</mark>ious, cultural, or otherwise—between the historical dynasty and the contemporary polity/polities existin<mark>g</mark> in the same re<mark>g</mark>ion. As the succession of states and the identities of the rulers, elites, and subjects or citizens are complex and contentious issues, the classification of dynasties may be multidimensional. For example, the Ayyubid dynasty has been variously described as "E<mark>g</mark>yptian" and "Syrian" based on its <mark>g</mark>eo<mark>g</mark>raphic location and the titles held by its monarchs; "Kurdish" accordin<mark>g</mark> to its rulers' ethnicity; "Arabized" accordin<mark>g</mark> to its cultural identity; and "Muslim", "Islamic", and "Sunni" based on its reli<mark>g</mark>ious faith.

For example, apart from previously rulin<mark>g</mark> over the possessions of the British Empire and numerous soverei<mark>g</mark>n states that later abolished the monarchy, the House of Windsor remains the rulin<mark>g</mark> dynasty of 15 soverei<mark>g</mark>n states and their associated territories, and is therefore included in multiple sections.[1] Likewise, althou<mark>g</mark>h the Tan<mark>g</mark> dynasty existed as a sin<mark>g</mark>le realm, it had at various points in time ruled over China proper, Dzun<mark>g</mark>aria, the Tarim Basin, the Mon<mark>g</mark>olian Plateau, Inner Manchuria, Outer Manchuria, as well as parts of Central Asia, the Korean Peninsula, Vietnam, Siberia, and Af<mark>g</mark>hanistan, and is thus listed under multiple sections.[2][3][4]

Non-soverei<mark>g</mark>n dynasties could have once held soverei<mark>g</mark>n power (and vice versa). For example, as the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain was formerly an independent shiekdom but is now a constituent emirate of the United Arab Emirates, the currently non-soverei<mark>g</mark>n House of Mualla therefore held soverei<mark>g</mark>n power historically.
