Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the lineup for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums. Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band's music is featured in a number of other video games.

As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several lineup changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time, 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying and 1992's Fear of the Dark. In 1982, the band released The Number of the Beast – its first album with Bruce Dickinson, who replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer – which was a turning point in their career, helping establish them as one of heavy metal's most important artists.[2] The Number of the Beast is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]

Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours.[14] Released in 2006, A Matter of Life and Death, their 14th studio album, reached top sales in dozens of countries, initiating the series of Iron Maiden's highest-ranked albums. Their 2010 album, The Final Frontier, peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries and received widespread critical acclaim. Their 16th studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success, debuting at No. 1 in the album charts of 24 countries with physical sales and summary in 43 territories with physical and digital sales.[15][16][17] Most recently, their 17th studio album, Senjutsu, was released on 3 September 2021 and eventually reached No. 1 in 27 countries.[18][19][20]

Iron Maiden have sold over 130 million copies of their albums worldwide,[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] despite little radio or television support.[30] By 2022, their releases have been certified Silver, Gold and Platinum around 600 times worldwide.[31] Iron Maiden have become one of the most influential and revered rock bands of all time, and are credited with influencing countless bands and genres. Additionally, the band are consistently regarded as one of the greatest metal bands in the history of popular music. Critics have stated that the musicians elevated heavy metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist.[32][33][34][35] Iron Maiden are also ranked as one of the greatest live acts of all time.[36]

The band and its members have received multiple industry awards, including the Grammy Awards and its equivalents in other countries. Other accolades the band have received include Brit Awards,[37] Silver Clef Award,[38] Nordoff-Robbins Award,[39] Ivor Novello Awards,[40] Juno Awards,[41] Guinness Book of World Records,[42] Public Choice International,[43] Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards, ECHO Awards,[44][45] Top.HR Music Awards,[46][47] Žebřík Music Awards,[48] honorary doctorates, State Prizes,[49][50][51][52] sales recognition, marketing achievements recognition awards, charity, film and sport awards among many others. Iron Maiden were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk, BPI Hall of Fame and Kerrang! Hall of Fame.[53][54] The band are also a part of permanent exhibitions of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[55] British Music Experience,[56][57][58] Rock in Rio Wall of Fame[59] and Wacken Open Air Hall of Fame.[60] In 2023 Iron Maiden were honoured by Royal Mail UK with dedicated postal stamps and cards. Other bands honoured include the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Queen.[61][23]

Iron Maiden's lyrics cover such topics as history, literature, war, mythology, society and religion. Many of their songs are based on history, classic literature and film.[62][63] As of October 2019, the band have played some 2,500 live shows, performing for tens of millions of fans. For over 40 years, the musicians have been supported by their famous mascot, "Eddie", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, videos and merchandise. Originally designed by Derek Riggs, Eddie became the main attraction of Iron Maiden live shows, which feature theatrical elements like coloured backdrops, inflatables, pyrotechnics, elaborate lighting rigs, props and stage sets.[64]

History
Early years (1975–1978)

The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976. The building was officially named "The Birthplace of Iron Maiden".[65]
Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device.[66] They originally had the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden, so that name was chosen shortly after the band formed. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,[67] before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland, Stratford, London.[68] A few decades later, the pub was officially named "The Birthplace of Iron Maiden" and turned into a music pub with many mementos of the band's early years as part of London's rock music history.[69]

The original lineup was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked "energy or charisma on stage".[70] He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used makeup and fake blood during live performances.[70] Wilcock's friend, guitarist Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.[71] Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,[71] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.


Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.
Iron Maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.[72] Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,[73] as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.[67] A new lineup was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). After a single gig with the band in January 1978, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided keyboards did not suit the band's sound.[74] Dave Murray rejoined in late March 1978, and when Terry Wapram disapproved he was sacked. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, with Wapram, and drummer Barry Purkis left, as well. Doug Sampson was at Dennis and Thunderstick's last gig and so joined the band afterwards.

Harris, Murray and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new lineup.[75] A chance meeting at the Red Lion, a pub in Leytonstone, in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno.[76] Steve Harris stated, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge".[77] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult".[78]

Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)
Main articles: The Soundhouse Tapes, Iron Maiden (album), and Killers (Iron Maiden album)
On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.[79] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs,[79] the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called "Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.[80] Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, "Prowler", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine.[81] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager,[82] and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club.[83] Featuring only three tracks (one song, "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production),[84] all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks.[81]

In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI[85] and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist.[86] Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead.[87] Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.[88] Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of "Sanctuary" and "Wrathchild".[89] The release led to a tour that featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal (NWoBHM) movement.[90] According to different sources, between May 1976 and December 1979, the band played about 200 shows in Great Britain.[91][92]

Iron Maiden released their self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart.[93] The album included other early favourites such as "Running Free", "Transylvania", "Phantom of the Opera" and "Sanctuary" – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980 with almost 40,000 in attendance. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,[94] and was replaced by Smith in October 1980. In Europe, Iron Maiden played 28 shows to about 400,000 people (mainly Kiss fans). In December, the band played at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where their very first live video was filmed. Live at the Rainbow was released in May 1981, and the cuts "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" from this video received heavy rotation on MTV during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.[95][92][96]

Their eponymous debut album achieved critical acclaim in Japan, where Iron Maiden were named "The Best Newcoming Foreign Band" by readers of Music Life magazine and received their very first Gold certification.[97] Four decades later, Iron Maiden's debut album was ranked No. 13 of "The Greatest Hard Rock & Metal Albums Ever" published by journalists of opinion-forming Rolling Stone magazine and also named the third-most important metal debut album of all time. Iron Maiden is ranked at the similar positions in many other polls worldwide.[98][99]

In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, Killers. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, it had only two new songs written for the record: "Prodigal Son" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue"[100] (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe).[101] The leitmotif of the lyrics was a murder contemplated from different perspectives.[95] Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,[102] the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch,[103] who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.[104] The record was followed by the band's first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas. Iron Maiden played 45 shows in North America to several hundreds of thousands of fans, including two headline gigs in Canada.[105][106] Killers made the band's USA album charts debut, reaching No. 78 on the Billboard 200,[107] and they booked 132 shows to promote the album.[108] The band played the small or mid-size venues using standard type of stage equipment including 200 lamps, smoke machines, two backdrops with Eddie and four members of the crew wearing Eddie masks when the song "Iron Maiden" was played live.[108]

The band's second album featured the single "Twilight Zone/Wrathchild" (released as a double A-side) and speed metal opus "Purgatory", as well as two instrumental songs – "The Ides of March" and "Genghis Khan" – and the proto-thrash title track.[109] The music style of the album inspired generations of thrash, speed and power metal bands. The cover illustration by Derek Riggs became the first of many more iconic covers in the history of the genre.[95] Killers sold much better worldwide than the debut album, hitting the one million mark a year after launch, earning the group Gold certificates in Germany, Japan, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France (double Gold) and in the United Kingdom. The album debuted at No. 12 in the UK and reached the Top 10 and Top 20 in many countries around the world.[95][92]

The UK tour included the band's headline performance at the Hammersmith Odeon. However, Paul Di'Anno's addiction problems led to the cancellation of several German dates. In some of those cities, local fans reacted with street riots. Iron Maiden then toured Japan for the first time in seven shows. All tickets were sold out in record time, but further problems with Di'Anno forced the band to cancel two shows. The concert recordings from Nagoya were used on the mini-album Maiden Japan (Heavy Metal Army in Japan), which was released in September 1981.[95][92] The band visited Yugoslavia as a headliner of the Belgrade festival with 50,000 people in attendance. It was the first time the band had played behind the Iron Curtain and also a groundbreaking performance for a new generation of heavy metal artists in the so-called Eastern Bloc.[110] During the summer, Iron Maiden played several festivals in Europe, including appearances as "very special guests" at the Golden Summernights 1981 festival series held at Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg with 100,000 people, but also in Stuttgart and Darmstadt in front of an audience of tens of thousands.[92]

Success (1981–1985)

By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,[67] about which Di'Anno comments, "It wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day ... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much".[111] With his performances waning, Di'Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour,[112] at which point the band had already selected his replacement.[113]


Stage set 1982
After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival,[114] Bruce Dickinson, previously of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.[113] The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK.[112] For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played "Children of the Damned" and "22 Acacia Avenue", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.[115]

In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, The Number of the Beast, which became the band's first No. 1 record on the UK Albums Chart,[116] was a Top 10 hit in many other countries and reached No. 33 on the Billboard 200.[107][117] At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a "moral contribution" to "Children of the Damned", "The Prisoner" and "Run to the Hills".[118] For the second time, the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia and Europe, including a headline appearance for 40,000 people at the Reading Festival. Iron Maiden played 188 shows in 10 months.[92] For the very first time they presented a conceptual setting, including a specially designed stage and lighting with almost 400 lamps. Also, for the first time in the history of the band, a movable, 9.8-foot-tall (3 m) Eddie appeared on stage during the performance of the song "Iron Maiden".[92]

The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album's title track and "demonic" cover art,[117] and a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records in protest.[119] In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as "silliness"[120] and that the demonstrations in fact gave them "loads of publicity".[67] An American professor, Bryan A. Bardine, referring to the visual aspect of the band's third album, stated the authors' message seems to be understandable: "This album evokes power, passion and music that present darker themes and images".[121]

The band played over 100 dates in North America, supporting Scorpions, Judas Priest and Rainbow. Iron Maiden headlined some Canadian dates, New York, Chicago free shows and solo stops. They also performed at the biggest American festivals – Day on the Green, SuperFest, Pacific Jam, Rock Fest – which were held at big stadiums such as Rich Stadium, Anaheim Stadium, Oakland Alameda Coliseum or Comiskey Park.[92] Iron Maiden were quickly promoted to the avant-garde of heavy metal. The Number of the Beast is considered to be a groundbreaking album for modern heavy metal and has been listed on the album sales charts and the all-time heavy metal albums polls constantly.[92][122] The album's closing track, titled "Hallowed Be Thy Name", is considered one of the most important in the history of the genre. It has repeatedly held leading positions in various polls.[123] After the first year of its release, 2.5 million copies were sold.[124] A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future had opened: by 2010, the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.[125] This also marked the start of the "Golden Era" in the band's history.[122] The Number of the Beast is considered one of the major albums of all time (Top 3, Top 5) in heavy music, and by December 2021 had sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][126][13] In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust.[127] Although Harris stated his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,[128] Burr objected to this and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.[129]


Nicko McBrain has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982
Soon afterwards, the band traveled to the Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios.[130] In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, Piece of Mind, which reached the No. 3 spot in the UK[131] and No. 14 on the Billboard 200.[107] Piece of Mind features the successful singles "The Trooper" and "Flight of Icarus", the latter being notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.[132] Other notable songs of the album are "Where Eagles Dare" (named after the Clint Eastwood movie), "Revelations", "Die with Your Boots On" and the epic "To Tame a Land", which is based on Frank Herbert's Dune.[133] Iron Maiden played 151 concerts in Europe and North America as a part of the World Piece Tour. They also booked their first major North America tour as headliners.[92] Nearly 90 shows took place in 10,000+ capacity arenas, and the band sold out Madison Square Garden with a crowd of 20,000.[134] In London, they played four consecutive nights at the Hammersmith Odeon, then toured many large venues across western Europe, including an extensive German leg. The World Piece Tour was concluded by two headlining performances at the Rock & Pop Festival at the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund. The show was broadcast live to 300 million people with the exception of the song "Iron Maiden" due to the band's "violent behaviour on stage".[134][92]

The stage, lighting, and sound gear for the tour was the next step in the visual development of the band's live performances. Iron Maiden used, inter alia, a 100,000-watt sound system, a first for any group, designed specially for large sports arenas.[92] The lighting equipment, in addition to the standard ramps with spots, included four movable, triangular ramps, rising to different heights above the stage and illuminating the audience from different angles. These were the first ramps of this type in the world, and their construction became a significant step forward for the creation of mobile, extensive lighting systems used on subsequent tours. The lighting platform was based on over 520 lamps.[92] As with the previous tour, the band had a conceptual set design with a number of props referring to the image of the promoted album, the movable Eddie and his big head emerging from behind the stage. Use of pyrotechnics was also increased.[122]

UK magazine Kerrang! summed up the passing year, and readers were asked to select 100 best metal albums of all time, resulting with Piece of Mind ranked first, followed by The Number of the Beast, and the band's other releases were all in the Top 50.[92] The rankings in other regions of the world were similar. Iron Maiden became the most serious contenders for the title of "the biggest heavy metal formation in the world". In the year of the premiere, the circulation of the fourth album exceeded 2 million copies sold.[122][92] In September 1983, the band released a video compilation, Video Pieces, which contained official clips from The Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind.[135]

Soon after the success of Piece of Mind and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, Powerslave, on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles "2 Minutes to Midnight" and "Aces High", an emotional title track, as well as "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", which is based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem of the same name and has a runtime of over 13 minutes.[136] Powerslave was another chart success, reaching No. 12 on the Billboard 200[107] and No. 2 in the UK as a result of band's record company EMI's third Now That's What I Call Music! pop compilation, which should not be listed.[137][138]

The tour following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band's largest to date, consisting of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,[136] playing to an estimated three and a half million people.[139][140] The most elaborate tour to date used a number of custom-made props, such as extensible golden sarcophagi, a 33-foot (10 m) Eddie appearing as a big and mummified walking phantom, the conceptual stage set with Ancient Egyptian motifs and extensive pyrotechnics.[139] The band's own equipment travelled in six 45-foot (14 m) articulated trucks, and touring needed three buses for 60 road crew and two more for the musicians. The PA front system power had 153,000 watts and an additional 21,000 for stage monitors. A custom-built and flexible lighting rig held nearly 800 lamps in vast triangular ramps of moving aluminium. The band's 2008–2009 tour, Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, featured a stage set that largely emulated the World Slavery Tour.[141][92]

The tour started in August 1984 with five shows in Poland. Iron Maiden were the first Western artists to bring full-scale production behind the Iron Curtain.[122] Average attendance in Poland was estimated as 12,000 people, plus a few thousand outside each night. The inaugural show in Warsaw, held at Torwar Arena, gathered over 14,000 people and 5,000 more listened outside.[142][143] In Budapest, some 50,000 fans filled a parking lot.[144][145] Iron Maiden played to full-capacity crowds all over Europe and the UK. 105 dates in North America were massive successes. Many shows were played back to back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts at Long Beach Arena for a combined audience of 54,000 fans.[122] In New York City, the band played five nights at Radio City Music Hall, and only Dickinson's falling ill prevented the five scheduled shows from becoming seven.[92]

The band's third official video, entitled Behind the Iron Curtain, was released in October 1984. The World Slavery Tour documentary brought footage of the band touring eastern Europe in 1984, performing shows in the countries visited, and additionally showed the musicians playing at a Polish wedding in Poznań. The video contained two promotional clips for songs from the Powerslave album, brand-new live tracks, and special interviews with musicians and members of the road crew. Behind the Iron Curtain was the first documentary published by a Western artist that showed them touring the countries of Eastern Bloc. MTV broadcast an expanded version (about one hour long) of the documentary, which became a part of the Live After Death DVD released in February 2008.[92][146]

Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined the Rock in Rio festival with Queen for an audience estimated at 350,000–500,000 people.[147][148] The tour was physically grueling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).[149] This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,[150] with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.[151] In October 1985, Iron Maiden released their first double live album, Live After Death, which was a critical and commercial success, peaking at No. 19 on the Billboard 200[107] and No. 2 in the UK.[152] The album was recorded at Long Beach Arena and also features additional tracks from four nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo. Live After Death is widely regarded as one of the greatest live albums of all time and has been described by Classic Rock as "the last great live album of the vinyl era" and a seminal heavy metal live release.[153][154] Along with the album, an official video with the same name was released, and it debuted at No. 1 in the UK charts and topped music video charts worldwide. Live After Death live video was digitally remastered and released in 2008 as a part of the "History of Iron Maiden" series.[142] In November 1985, Iron Maiden were named the best rock and metal band in the world and awarded at Public Choice International. This recognition sealed their status as the biggest heavy metal band in the world.[43]

Experimentation (1986–1989)

Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, Somewhere in Time. For the first time in the band's history, synthesised bass and guitars were featured to add textures and layers to the sound.[155] The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single "Wasted Years", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.[156] While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was "left to [his] own devices" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with "Wasted Years", "Sea of Madness" and "Stranger in a Strange Land",[157] the last of which would be the album's second single.[156] The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching No. 11 on the Billboard 200[107] and No. 2 in the UK charts. It almost immediately reached Gold status in the UK and Platinum in the US, where it eventually went Double Platinum, according to band's official biography, Run to the Hills.[152][158] The Somewhere on Tour production was the most ambitious to date. Somewhere in Time features "Caught Somewhere in Time" as an opening track, the anthemic "Heaven Can Wait" and the progressive epic opus "Alexander the Great" closing the album.[159] The tour required seven or eight 45-foot articulated trucks packed with over 100 tons of equipment, three crowd buses for 60 people and two nightliners for five musicians. The band-owned, customised Turbosound system was probably the biggest in the world used indoors. Total power (PA and stage monitors) was estimated at 180,000 watts. The vast and flexible lighting rig held over 1,100 lamps hung over a futuristic stage set, including flying space ships, inflatable props, laser guns, pyrotechnics, hydraulic stands, backdrops and monumental Eddie's appearance.[159]

Somewhere on Tour was a big success worldwide. The band played 157 shows for two and a half million fans. Eighty-one shows in North America were spectacular successes, playing both bigger indoor arenas and some stadiums. Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands fans in each country.[142] A massive UK leg, including six nights at Hammersmith Odeon, was sold out in advance.[159] In October 1987, Iron Maiden released the 12 Wasted Years video documentary, focusing on the history of the band from 1975 to 1987. It included several rare videos and interviews from the band's career, some of which were later included on the 2004 documentary The Early Days. In March 2013, Iron Maiden included the full documentary in a reissue of their 1989 concert film, Maiden England.[160]

The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988. A concept album recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich[161] and based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card,[162] it was the band's first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith.[162] After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.[163] Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No. 1 in the UK charts[164] and reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200.[107] It initially only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.[165] Eventually band's seventh opus reached the one million copies threshold and achieved Platinum status.[166][158] The album incorporated many progressive rock influences and spawned three hit singles – "Can I Play with Madness", "The Evil That Men Do" and "The Clairvoyant" – along with the expressive "Moonchild", "Infinite Dreams", an epic title track, "The Prophecy" and "Only the Good Die Young", which was inspired by Aleister Crowley's works.[167][92]

After the blockbuster tour in North America, Iron Maiden were headliners of the Monsters of Rock festivals in Europe for the first time. They headlined stadiums and festivals in the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.[168] During the following tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.[169] Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses and Helloween.[170] The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during Guns N' Roses' performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.[169] The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham, recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. The video debuted at top spots of worldwide music videos charts.[171]

To promote the album, the band hosted an evening of television, radio and press interviews at Castle Schnellenberg in Attendorn, Germany, prior to the record's release,[172] before holding a small number of "secret" club shows under the name "Charlotte and the Harlots" at Empire, Cologne and L'Amour, New York.[173] In May, the group set out on a supporting tour, which saw them perform 103 shows to well over two million people worldwide over seven months.[172] To recreate the album's keyboards onstage, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris' bass technician, to play the keys throughout the tour, during which he would perform the song "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son" on a forklift truck under the alias of "The Count" (for which he would wear a black cape and mask). Kenney has served as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist on 2000s Brave New World.[174] Stage set and equipment was transported in dozens of trucks and was the most elaborate to date and one of the biggest in the world, including over 200,000 watts of PA and over 1,500 spot lamps.[174][175] Iron Maiden was included in the Guinness Book of World Records Museum for its performance at the Monsters of Rock festival in 1988.[176][177]

Upheaval (1989–1994)
Main articles: No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)
During a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold.[178] Vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990,[179] followed by a tour.[180] At the same time, to mark the band's 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of 10 CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.[92] The band also released the career-spanning video compilation entitled The First Ten Years: The Videos[181] (in 1992 re-issued as From There to Eternity).[182] Sales figures by the end of the 1980s credited the band with over 25 million albums sold, 10 million of which were in the US, along with over 5 million videos sold in the States, which gave Iron Maiden six of 120 Gold and Platinum certificates received worldwide. The Number of the Beast became the band's best-selling album, selling 6 million copies in the eight years since its release.[183] This sealed the group's status as the main representative of the heavy metal genre at the time.[139] Iron Maiden set new records in the UK: six singles in the Top 5, 10 double maxi-singles in the Top 10, the highest position ever for a debut single from a rock band, the most albums in the Top 10 for a British performer (excluding the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Queen) and 20 singles consecutively released on the charts.[184][185]

After the break, Iron Maiden began work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking. Smith disagreed with the "stripped down" style they were leaning towards.[186] Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band's first new member in seven years.[180] The album No Prayer for the Dying was released in October 1990.[187] It contained the hit singles "Holy Smoke" and "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter", the band's first – and, to date, only – UK Singles Chart No. 1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo project for the soundtrack of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.[188] The song was banned by the BBC, and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown. In 1990, Bruce Dickinson received the Golden Raspberry Awards in category "The Worst Original Song" for the band's most successful single in Great Britain.[189] Dickinson's composition was nominated to an American Music Award in category "Best Rock Song".[190] In 1992, "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter" received another nomination to Brit Awards in category "Best British Single".[191] Iron Maiden's eighth studio album debuted at No. 2 in the UK albums chart[188] and No. 17 on the Billboard 200.[107] No Prayer for the Dying signalled the return of Iron Maiden to the roots of their musical style, in particular in its simplicity of composition and raw sound.[192][92][186]

The No Prayer on the Road tour was booked for 120 shows in Europe, North America and Japan. The main supporting act for Iron Maiden were an American thrash metal band called Anthrax. The tour started with 20 dates in British music theatres and continued in European and American arenas. Thirty-three shows in continental Europe were sold out with a reported 530,000 fans attending.[193] In 1991, Iron Maiden played North America, Japan and outdoors in France, Denmark and Switzerland. For the first time the band headlined Roskilde Festival for 60,000 fans.[92] Following large-scale stage shows the band played in the '80s, Iron Maiden opted for a less elaborate production style, including only mobile and the big Eddie, traditional lighting rig and large backdrops. Once again, Iron Maiden played for some two million fans.[194][193]

After another extensive tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, Fear of the Dark, which was released in 1992. The title track became a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No. 1 in the UK albums chart and No. 12 on the Billboard 200,[107][195] the release also included the No. 2 single "Be Quick or Be Dead", the No. 21 single "From Here to Eternity", "Wasting Love" and the pacifistic anthem "Afraid to Shoot Strangers", which is based on the 1990–91 Gulf War.[196] The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first-ever Latin American leg (12 stadium and arena shows after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries: UK, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden.[197] Iron Maiden's second performance at Donington Park, for a sold-out audience of 75,000 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),[198][199] was filmed for the audio and video release Live at Donington and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform "Running Free".[199] Christian organisations prevented Iron Maiden from performing in Chile and accused them of being "emissaries of satanic propaganda".[200]

Fear of the Dark Tour 1992 included 66 concerts played on five continents for well over a million fans. The band presented a powerful and elaborate lighting rig (over 1000 lamps and lasers) and scenery partly reminiscent of what they had used in the 1980s. The set for the Monsters of Rock concerts was completed by the huge Eddie crowning the stage and screens. Iron Maiden made their first appearance in Iceland and returned to Oceania after a seven-year hiatus. The tour in Japan was the largest in the history of the group. The tour witnessed the personal conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.[92][201]

In 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package):[202] the first, A Real Live One, was released in March 1993 and featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and the second, A Real Dead One, was released after Dickinson had left the band and featured songs from 1980 to 1984. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.[203] Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to "make like Mr. Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right", and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.[204] On 1 May 1993, the band performed at the "Primo Maggio Free Festival" in Rome, Piazza San Giovanni. According to different sources, the crowd was estimated between 500,000 and 1 million people.[205][206] The band toured an extensive Italian leg and visited Russia for the very first time, playing three consecutive nights at Moscow's Olympic Stadium.[197] Bruce Dickinson played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993. The show was filmed, broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell.[207]

Blaze Bayley era, The X Factor and Virtual XI (1994–1999)
Main articles: The X Factor (album) and Virtual XI

Blaze Bayley, Iron Maiden frontman from 1994 to 1998
In 1994, the title track from Fear of the Dark album received a Grammy Awards nomination for "Best Metal Performance", a first for Iron Maiden.[208] The band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.[209] Harris' preferred choice from the outset,[210] Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.[211]

After a three-year hiatus from studio releases – a record for the band at the time – Iron Maiden released their next studio album, The X Factor. The band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No. 8).[212] The album would go on to win "Album of the Year" awards in France, Spain and Germany.[213] After more than 10 years of Iron Maiden's constant domination in the readers' polls of Kerrang! magazine, the band's founder Steve Harris received the prestigious "Kerrang Kreativity Award".[214] The record included the 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", the band's longest song since "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", as well as the singles "Man on the Edge" (based on the film Falling Down)[215] and "Lord of the Flies", based on the novel of the same name.[216] The release is notable for its "dark" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.[213] The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing their first shows in Israel and South Africa as well as Malta, Bulgaria and Romania in Europe. The tour concluded in the Americas. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the Monsters of Rock festival in São Paulo, Brazil.[217]

Generally, Iron Maiden booked smaller venues, including clubs, theatres and mid-size arenas, especially in the States. The band played in stadiums and large arenas in South America and resurged with mainstream popularity in Greece. The stage production was smaller than previous years but included many elements Iron Maiden were famous for: two Eddies, mobile lighting rig, and conceptual stage sets or backdrops. The X Factor sold 1.3 million copies, the lowest sales result since 1981.[218] After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, Best of the Beast. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, "Virus", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band. Initially, the musicians planned to release a video compilation but dropped the idea due to the unsatisfying quality of available video remastering.[219]

In 1998, Iron Maiden released Virtual XI, whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score 1 million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.[220][221] The album peaked at No. 16 in the UK, the band's lowest for a new studio record.[222] At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington (which was given a mainstream release for the first time). Virtual XI features the singles "The Angel and the Gambler" and "Futureal", as well as epic opus entitled "Clansman" and the power ballad "Como Estais Amigos", which is dedicated to all of the people who died in the Falklands War.[223] "Futureal" stood for two weeks at the first position on US Metal Radio charts.[224][225]

Prior to the album's release, the band organised a publicity tour where they held football matches in different European countries with some guest musicians and pro-footballers from the UK and Europe.[226] Following the more "back to the basics" stage sets they had been using following 1988's Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour, the band returned to the idea of an elaborate stage set.[227] The musicians and management stated Virtual XI World Tour would bring a "massive show, with huge production, including stadium-levelling amounts of pyro". They also announced the participation of Dave Lights, who did their lighting and effects in the 1980s. Management booked more mid-size arenas and stadiums in Latin America, including a headline show at the Monsters of Rock festival in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as the final show of the tour.[228] Finally, the band used bigger backdrops, more elaborate lighting rigs, a conceptual stage set and an inflatable Eddie head and hands, which embraced both sides of the stage. Fans did not see pyrotechnics and the kind of production comparable with '80s monumental stage sets as was previously announced. The tour was a big disappointment, both to the band and the fans.[229]

Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.[230] The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour,[231] although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.[232]

Return of Dickinson and Smith, Brave New World (1999–2002)
Main articles: Ed Hunter and Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)

Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three–guitar line-up.
While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.[233] Although Harris admitted that he "wasn't really into it" at first, he then thought, "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce and we know what he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so ... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it."[233]

The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999,[234] along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.[235] With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (called "The Three Amigos"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.[236] Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game of the same name starring the band's mascot.[237] The 1999 reunion tour was the biggest enterprise in terms of production since Fear of the Dark Tour 1992. The band visited North America and several European countries and featured a conceptual show inspired by scenes from the game. Iron Maiden used a two-part stage related to the game's graphics, three movable screens surrounded by light ramps, projectors, huge backdrops, pyrotechnics (for the first time since 1988), colourful props, visuals and two versions of Eddie also drawn from the game. The equipment travelled in seven huge trucks.[92]

One of Dickinson's primary concerns on rejoining the group "was whether we would in fact be making a real state-of-the-art record and not just a comeback album."[233] The result was 2000's Brave New World.[238] Not satisfied with the results from Harris' personal studio, Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex,[239] which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley.[238] The new release was promoted by two singles "The Wicker Man" and "Out of the Silent Planet", both of them achieving success on the UK singles chart.[240] Thematic influences continued with "The Wicker Man" – based on the 1973 British cult film of the same name – and "Brave New World" – a title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel of the same name.[241] The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound featured in some earlier recordings, along with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.[241] The album was a commercial and artistic success and is considered a modern classic alongside the band's releases from the '80s. Brave New World charted at No. 7 in the UK Album Charts and No. 39 on the Billboard 200 and Top 5 in many other territories, and eventually went Gold and Platinum in a dozen other countries worldwide. The album re-established the band as a "metal powerhouse".[242][92][243]

The reunion world tour that followed consisted of well over 100 dates (including 31 shows of the 1999 tour), and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of over 250,000.[244] While the performance was being produced for a CD and a highly successful DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio,[245] the band took a year off from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy to raise funds for former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.[246] The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005,[247] and 2007,[248] before his death in 2013.[249]

During the 2000–2002 tour, Iron Maiden played 91 shows for over two million people in 33 countries. The band visited big arenas, stadiums and performed at the biggest festivals.[250] The world tour, dubbed "Metal 2000 Tour," was a great undertaking and intended to restore the concert glory of the band from the '80s. Iron Maiden used a huge lighting rig with moving parts and 600 lamps, pyrotechnics, a walking Eddie, a large wicker Eddie with dancers in the center, a burning cross lifting Bruce Dickinson up, and backdrops and conceptual scenery related to the Brave New World album cover illustration.[251] In addition to their touring success, the band were nominated twice for the annual Grammy Awards[252] and received the International Achievement Award at the 2001 Ivor Novello Awards, in recognition of Maiden's reign as one of Great Britain's biggest musical exports[253] Iron Maiden was hailed as the most successful British metal group on British Channel 4, and The Number of the Beast album was included in the prestigious Eagle Vision's "Classic Albums" series.[92] In 2001 the band won a gong at the Online Music Awards Germany in the category, "Best Artist Website".[254]

In November 2002, Iron Maiden released their third "best of" compilation Edward the Great, and a limited edition of a collector's metal casket entitled Eddie's Archive. The special box included three double CDs: BBC Archives, Beast over Hammersmith and Best of the 'B' Sides with unique live recordings from Reading Festivals 1980 and 1982, Donington's Monsters of Rock Festival 1988, BBC Rock Friday 1979, songs from B-sides of particular singles and a live recording of London's Hammersmith Odeon 1982 in its entirety. The box also included a parchment scroll with the band's family tree (by Pete Frame), a customised shot glass and a metal ring.[255]

Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death (2003–2007)
Main articles: Dance of Death (album) and A Matter of Life and Death (album)
In June 2003 Iron Maiden released a double DVD promo-video compilation entitled Visions of the Beast, which went multi-platinum worldwide. At the same period, the band began a promotional tour for the new DVD and forthcoming album.[256] The summer leg of the tour's run was entitled the Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour and included 57 shows in Europe and North America. They played indoor arenas, stadiums, American amphitheaters and headlined large festivals such as Roskilde, Heineken Jammin' Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park (combined attendance of 130,000) and the first Download Festival held at Donington Park as a successor to Monsters of Rock.[257] The Spanish leg of the 2003 tour spanned nine shows, with 160,000 fans in attendance. This was the most successful attendance record for the band in that territory in band's career. 28 more shows were played in Europe to 720,000 fans and Iron Maiden visited the US and Canada to play 29 shows for the hundreds of thousands of people. Fans were treated to classic material, alongside the brand new song "Wildest Dreams", the first promotional single from the forthcoming studio album.[258] The tour was another visual attraction, the stage set and theme referring to the most popular incarnations of Eddie along with all the lighting effects and pyrotechnics fans had come to expect. There was also a public lobotomy of the group's mascot taking place during the song "Iron Maiden".[92]

Following their Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released Dance of Death, their thirteenth studio album, which was met with worldwide critical and commercial success. The album reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart[259] and No. 18 on the Billboard 200.[107] Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as Killers, Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast.[260] As usual, historical, and literary references were present, with "Montségur" in particular, focussing on the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244,[261] and "Paschendale" relating to the significant battle which took place during the First World War.[262] The album features the successful singles "Wildest Dreams" and "Rainmaker", alongside the epic title track and live favourite "No More Lies". No More Lies was released as an EP on 29 March 2004 and featured the track alongsided an orchestral version of Paschendale and an 'electric' version of the song "Journeyman". "Journeyman", a departure for the band, featured on the album as a mostly acoustic ballad, something that had not been attempted since the song "Prodigal Son" had appeared on "Killers" in 1982. The album also touted the first ever song composed by drummer Nicko McBrain entitled "The New Frontier". The band recorded the album at London's Sarm West Studios which they used again for the following album in 2006.[263]

The Dance of Death Tour 2003–04 began in September 2003 and was the band's most theatrical tour to date. The stage portrayed a medieval castle with an opening gates, Grim Reaper statues on either side of the stage, large towers, and two versions of Eddie as the ominous Grim Reaper character.[92] Bruce Dickinson used many props and costumes, such as a sinister black coat, carnival masks, a throne, and a World War I uniform and helmet. During the performance of "Paschendale", fans witnessed the stage being transformed into a battlefield, with deceased soldier mannequins, trenches, barbed wire and barricades, and the lighting system imitating flashes of explosions that echoed through the powerful sound system. Iron Maiden played 53 shows visiting European indoor arenas, North America, Latin American stadiums and Japan.[258] During the tour, members of the band took a part in charity football events called Music Soccer Six. In 2004 Iron Maiden received the Special Achievement Award at the Nordoff-Robbins Silver Clef awards.[39] During the album tour, the band's performance at Westfalenhalle, in Dortmund, Germany, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD, entitled Death on the Road.[264]

In 2005, the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour, which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days, only featured material from their first four albums and was the first of three retrospective tours in the "History of Iron Maiden" series referring to the '80s.[265] As part of this celebration of their earlier years, "The Number of the Beast" single was re-released[266] and went straight to No. 3 in the UK Chart.[267] The tour included many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000.[268] This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television all over Europe to approximately 60 million viewers.[269] The tour was the first step in transforming the reborn Iron Maiden into a stadium-size band. The stage production was larger than ever before and reflected the visual elements from the tours promoting the group's first four albums. The band used more backdrops, several incarnations of Eddie, and a more powerful lighting rig with triangular ramps, trusses and pyrotechnics.[92]

Following this run of European shows, the band co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. An average Ozzfest concert attendance was estimated at 30,000 people. The San Bernardino show before 50,000 fans earned international press coverage after it was sabotaged by singer Ozzy Osbourne's family, who took offence to Dickinson's remarks about reality television, in what became known as The Eggfest Incident.[270] The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26–28 August,[271] and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August. For the second time, the band played a charity show for The Clive Burr MS Trust Fund, which took place at the Hammersmith Apollo.[247] That same year, the band were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.[272] In the same period, Iron Maiden were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame.[53]


Vocalist Bruce Dickinson during A Matter of Life and Death World Tour. Throughout the tour's first leg, the band played the A Matter of Life and Death album in its entirety.
At the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, released in autumn 2006. While not a concept album,[273] war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics, as well as in the cover artwork. The release was a critical and commercial success, earning the band their first top ten on the Billboard 200 and debuting at number one in the album charts of 13 countries[274][92] The new effort featured the singles, "Different World" and "The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg", but the album itself grabbed critical attention for its focus on dark themes and reflections on the futility of war. It was also noted for progressive compositions such as "Brighter Than a Thousand Suns", "The Longest Day", "For the Greater Good of God" and "The Legacy".[275] Among many accolades, Maiden's fourteenth album received the Album of the Year award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.[276]

A supporting tour followed, during which they played the album in its entirety; response to this was mixed. Iron Maiden played in North America, Japan and Europe selling out indoor arenas everywhere. They played multiple shows in venues such as the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London, Forum di Assago in Milano, and Globen Arena in Stockholm or Hartwall Arena in Helsinki.[277][278] The setting of the 2006–07 tour was an extension of the ideas accompanying the presentation of the song "Paschendale" from the Dance of Death tour. The stage set resembled a battlefield fortification featuring sand bags, barricades, trenches and the like. Movable light ramps were covered with camouflage netting and khaki fabric. There were also uniformed paratrooper mannequins woven into the scene. Additional lighting was also used, and at the climax of the show, the set turned into a huge moving tank.[92][279]

The second part of the "A Matter of Life and Death" tour, which took place in 2007, was dubbed "A Matter of the Beast" to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Number of the Beast album's release, and included appearances at several major festivals and stadiums worldwide.[280] The tour opened in the Middle East with the band's first ever performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival for 25,000 people,[281] after which they played to over 40,000 people at the Bangalore Palace Grounds,[282] marking the first concert by any major heavy metal band in the Indian sub-continent.[281]

The band went on to play a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park,[283] to approximately 80,000 people.[284] Iron Maiden performed at Olympic Stadium (Rome) in Rome, Bazaly Stadium in Ostrava, Lokomotiv Stadium in Sofia, Sudweststadion in Ludwigshafen, Fair Arena in Belgrade, Bezigrad Stadion in Ljubjana, and played shows in the big indoor arenas of Düsseldorf and Athens. Finally, the band headlined the BBK Live Festival in Bilbao, Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Fields of Rock Festival in Biddinghuizen, and the Heineken Jammin Festival in Venice.[279] On 24 June they ended the tour with a performance at London's Brixton Academy in aid of The Clive Burr MS Trust fund.[248]

Somewhere Back in Time World Tour was one of the most important in Iron Maiden career
On 5 September 2007, the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, which tied in with the DVD release of their Live After Death album.[285] The setlist for the tour consisted of successes from the 1980s, with a specific emphasis on the Powerslave era for set design.[285] The first part of the tour, commencing in Mumbai, India on 1 February 2008, consisted of 24 concerts in 21 cities, travelling nearly 50,000 miles in the band's own chartered aeroplane,[286] named "Ed Force One".[287] They played their first ever concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992.[citation needed]

The tour led to the release of a new compilation album, entitled Somewhere Back in Time, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, as well as several live versions from Live After Death.[288] The tour turned out to be the biggest concert undertaking in the group's history so far. Iron Maiden have performed in huge stadiums and arenas in every corner of the world. Only seven concerts in Scandinavia saw over 250,000 viewers gathered at such venues as Ullevi Stadion, Olympiastadion in Stockholm and Helsinki, Ratina Stadion in Finland and Valle Hovin in Oslo. According to Live Nation Scandinavia, the band attracted the largest audience ever for a rock artist in this region of Europe. In 2008–09 in Latin America, the musicians gave as many as 27 concerts for about a million people in total. It was a record for a heavy rock performer.[92][289]

The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour continued with two further legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008, during which the band used a more expansive stage-set, including further elements of the original Live After Death show.[290] With the sole UK concert taking place at Twickenham Stadium, this would be the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country.[291] The three 2008 legs of the tour were remarkably successful; it was the second highest-grossing tour of the year for a British artist.[292]

The last part of the tour took place in February and March 2009, with the band, once again, using "Ed Force One".[293] The final leg included the band's first ever appearances in Peru and Ecuador, as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years.[294] The band also played another show in India (their third in the country within a span of 2 years) at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20,000. At their concert in São Paulo on 15 March, Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non-festival show of their career, with an overall attendance of 100,000 people.[295][296] The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break. Overall, the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two and a half million people worldwide over both years.[297] At the 2009 Brit Awards, Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act.[298] Voted for by the public, the band reportedly won by a landslide.[299]

On 20 January 2009, the band announced that they were to release a full-length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009. Entitled Iron Maiden: Flight 666, it was filmed during the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour between February and March 2008.[300] Flight 666 was co-produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI, with D&E Entertainment sub-distributing in the US.[301] The film went on to have a Blu-ray, DVD, and CD release in May and June,[297] topping the music DVD charts in 25 countries.[296] In most of them the release went Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum.[92]

Following announcements that the band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing,[302] The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March and featured three singles "The Final Frontier", "El Dorado" and "Coming Home", as well as epic, progressive opuses such as "Isle of Avalon", "The Talisman" and "When The Wild Wind Blows".[303] The album, the band's fifteenth, was released on 16 August,[304] garnering critical acclaim[305] and the band's greatest commercial success in their current history, reaching No. 1 in twenty-eight countries worldwide.[306] The Final Frontier debuted at No. 4 on Billboard 200 reaching the highest American album charts position to date.[307] Although Steve Harris had been quoted in the past as claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases,[308] band members have since confirmed that there will be at least one further record.[309] The album was band's next commercial success, achieving Gold or Platinum status in 24 countries around the world.[92] Iron Maiden were awarded with the special sales recognition plaque for selling over 750,000 of their albums in Finland.[310]

The album's supporting tour saw the band perform 101 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of well over two and a half million,[311] including their first visits to Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea,[306] before concluding in London on 6 August 2011.[312] As the tour's 2010 leg preceded The Final Frontier's release, the band made "El Dorado" available as a free download on 8 June,[304] which would go on to win the award for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011.[313] It was the band's first win following two previous Grammy nominations ("Fear of the Dark" in 1994 and "The Wicker Man" in 2001).[314] During both years of the tour band headlined the biggest festivals in the world, including Rock Werchter, Roskilde, Nova Rock, Pukkelpop, Soundwave (five dates), Wacken, Sziget, Ottawa Bluesfest, Festival d'été de Québec also Sonisphere Festival dates in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Switzerland.

Iron Maiden in Ottawa in 2010 during The Final Frontier World Tour
On 15 March, a new compilation to accompany 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced. Entitled From Fear to Eternity, the original release date was set at 23 May, but was later delayed to 6 June.[316] The double disc set covers the period 1990–2010 (the band's most recent eight studio albums),[316] and, as on Somewhere Back in Time, live versions with Bruce Dickinson were included in place of original recordings which featured other vocalists, in this case Blaze Bayley.

In a press release regarding From Fear to Eternity, band manager Rod Smallwood revealed that Iron Maiden would release a new concert video to DVD in 2011, filmed in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour.[317] On 17 January 2012, the band announced that the new release, entitled En Vivo!, based on footage from the Chile concert, would be made available worldwide on CD, LP, DVD, and Blu-ray on 26 March, except for the United States and Canada (where it was released on 27 March). DVD topped the music video charts around the world to achieve similar success as previous ones.[318][319] In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew.[320] In December 2012, one song from the release ("Blood Brothers") was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.[321]

The Final Frontier World Tour set design referred to the visual conventions known from the cover of The Final Frontier album.[322] It resembled a modified space station (Satellite–15), crowned with 10-meter radar towers with spotlights. The lighting system was developed the most since 2000 and it consisted of two semicircular ramps and triangular modules with sets of various light points. Two versions of Eddie the Alien were also prepared, the movable one and in the form of a huge monster's bust and paws emerging from behind the stage. Panoramic backdrops referred to the illustrations contained in the booklet of the promoted album.[92]


Iron Maiden used even more pyros than on previous tours. 2013 indoor arena show.
On 15 February 2012, the band announced their third retrospective Maiden England World Tour 2012–14, which was based around the video of the same name.[323] The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, which included the band's record-breaking fifth headline performance at Donington Park with 100,000 fans in attendance,[324][318][325] their first show at the newly built national stadium in Stockholm,[326] a return to the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil,[327] and their debut appearance in Paraguay.[328] In August 2012, Steve Harris stated that the Maiden England video would be re-issued in 2013,[329] with a release date later set for 25 March 2013 in DVD, CD, and LP formats under the title Maiden England '88.[330]

Maiden England World Tour stage set was built in an Arctic-style in many aspects reminding Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour. The band presented wraparound stage including some special platforms and podiums. Stage set and backdrops portrayed a dozen of the frozen pictures of Eddie monster.[331] Fans could see the three incarnations of band's mascot and movable, custom-made elements of stage props as organs with silver pipes, frozen sculptures of Eddie, the crystal ball and movable lighting rig imitating construction from an era of 1988.[331] Iron Maiden decided to extend the pyrotechnics using even more than on previous tours, as Bruce Dickinson said "we like to alternate it every other year, because if you get the reputation that you've got to go and see a band because of the pyro and then you don't do the pyro, people think, 'Oh, I won't bother then."[332] The tour was even bigger logistical challenge than a few previous ones. Michele Stokley, organiser of Sarnia Bayfest stated, Iron Maiden "brought 22 tractor trailers and the [six] buses full of equipment for the show".[333]


Iron Maiden in Poland in 2014 during Maiden England World Tour
Iron Maiden closed their Maiden England World Tour in July 2014 headlining at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth. Musicians have impressed the crowds by having The Great War Display Team featuring Bruce Dickinson among its pilots, stage a sensational aerial dogfight in the skies above the Festival with band's frontman flying his very own WW1 German Fokker Dr1, just hours before taking to the stage. Iron Maiden headlining show marked the final chapter in the band's trilogy of tours performing their 80's repertoire.[334] The historical tour was another big commercial success in band's career. Over three years, 100 shows were undertaken in 32 countries before an estimated audience of not less than two million and a seven hundred thousand people.[335][92] Throughout the tour, consistent praise was received from music critics, with the band's performances and the stage show receiving very particular acclaim. Third retrospective tour established Iron Maiden's status as a stadium–filling band.[335][336]

In 2013 Iron Maiden in collaboration with Robinsons Brewery released their own beer called Trooper Ale. Since its launch, the 4.7% Premium British Beer that was Trooper original has become a leading player amongst British ales, exported to over 100 countries around the world. In 2015 Iron Maiden and their management were honored with a Golden Disc Award for reaching the 10 million Trooper Ale sales threshold.[337] In 2021 the band and Robinsons Brewery celebrated over 30 million Trooper pints sold around the globe. The year also marked the 8th anniversary of their hugely successful collaboration. Trooper has won multiple gold medals at the prestigious British Bottlers' Institute Awards, as well as awards at the World Beer Awards, Global Beer Masters, International Beer Challenge and International Brewing and Cider Awards (aka "Oscars of the brewing and cider world") among many others.[338][339] On 5 April 2023, the band began working with the German brewery CREW Republic. This resulted in a beer called Progressive Lager. By the time Progressive Lager was released on the market, Iron Maiden-affiliated beer had sold well over 35 million pints, which was a record for an alcoholic beverage affiliated with a musical artist. Their work with breweries in Germany led to a huge increase in interest in the band in the country, as evidenced by the sold-out concert tours with shows in the largest sports arenas, stadiums and festivals taking place in Germany.[340] On the tenth anniversary of Trooper Beer, a special version was offered: Trooper X Imperial Stout (10% ABV) which was available in the cartoon package. During the period the band and Robinsons Brewery received a total of 18 awards for Trooper Original and 23 across the Trooper family of beers.[341]

The touring setting was (once again) one of the best in the career of the six-person line-up to date. Referring to the title and the leading topic of the album, the stage set reflected the architectural solutions characteristic of the ancient Maya religious buildings.[352] The group's mascot, Eddie the Head, appeared in a movable version, as the Mayan shaman, during the concert presentation of the title track from the album and as its big version during the presentation of "Iron Maiden" composition.[352] This one was presenting by a huge (ten meters), inflatable and exploding bust known from the album's cover painted by Mark Wilkinson. The band used an extensive pyrotechnics, lasers, movable lighting rig based on a dozen of pillars. The construction was built on a pyramid plan, with a circular, movable target placed in the central point, around which multicolored LED floodlights were mounted, giving the effect of light reflecting on the audience.[353]


Iron Maiden used Mayan-themed stage set and inflatable Devil Goat
The individual segments of the stage design, were placed on the stage's podium, as well as the two stepped towers placed in the back of the stage on its extreme sides. Initially they were turned in the opposite direction to the original, during the presentation of selected inscriptions which were properly illuminated, creating the effect of the real buildings.[354] Panoramic backdrops have been changed with each song referred to the graphic convention and paintings from the Mayan era, originally included in the booklet of the promoted album.[353] Bruce Dickinson changed his costumes several times and used a variety of props. Another attraction was an eight-meter long inflatable devil goat doll, emerging from behind the stage during the presentation of "The Number of the Beast" song.[355][353]

In February 2016, the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour, which saw them play concerts in 35 countries in North and South America, Asia, Australasia, Africa, and Europe, including their first ever performances in China, El Salvador, and Lithuania.

Iron Maiden in Chula Vista, CA, 2022
As many previous releases band's seventeenth studio effort was critically acclaimed and commercially successful album, especially appreciated for its ambitious epic scope. The band decided to continue the postponed Legacy of the Beast Tour in 2022 adding next 30+ dates in North America and some new territories in Europe. Tour production was planned as even more spectacular with using a brand new scenery dedicated to Senjutsu album and including the setlist changes to perform songs from the seventeenth studio effort. Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood commented: "Next summer we will finally get to play the huge European stadium and festival tour for Legacy of the Beast originally set for 2020. The new show will be even more spectacular so after our visit to Rock in Rio early September 2022 we have decided to take it back to our fans in North America and Mexico too, playing in cities or venues we did not get to last time we toured in 2019. We are also adding some of the great cities of eastern Europe we were not initially visiting! We'll be making a couple of additions and changes to the production and setlist to include some songs from our new album Senjutsu and are making the 2022 version of Legacy of the Beast even more spectacular than the acclaimed original show. You can be sure that we will still be featuring all the 'hits' and the key elements of the original tour like the Spitfire, Icarus, Hell, flamethrowers and pyro and the rest - but we will shake it up a bit and Trooper Eddie will have serious competition in the new 'Senjutsu world' we are adding".[385] During an appearance on the "Talk Is Jericho" podcast, Bruce Dickinson confirmed that Iron Maiden is planning to stage a tour where it will perform Senjutsu double album, in its entirety.[386] With 140 shows, Legacy of the Beast World Tour became the longest tour with Bruce Dickinson on vocals since the "Somewhere on Tour" in 1986–1987.

It is a paraphrase of "Up the Hammers", the phrase which refers to the London football club, West Ham United, of which founder Steve Harris is a fan.[427] Collection called "Die With Your Boots On" was published in 2020 as the result of a unique collaboration between Iron Maiden and West Ham United.[428] Band's mascot is the official symbol of Força Jovem youth soccer club Vasco.[429]

Iron Maiden's mascot, Eddie, is a perennial fixture in the band's science fiction and horror-influenced album cover art, as well as in live shows.[430] Originally a papier-mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows,[431] the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band's debut album cover, created by Derek Riggs.[432] Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well, including Melvyn Grant.[195] Eddie is also featured in the band's first-person shooter video game, Ed Hunter,[433] as well as their mobile role-playing game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast,[361] in addition to numerous T-shirts, posters and other band-related merchandise.[430] In 2008, he was awarded the "Icon Award" at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods,[434] while Gibson.com describes him as "the most recognisable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too".[435] In November 2021, the group's management teamed up with Marvel Entertainment. The result of the collaboration was, among others, a series of gadgets containing the image of the most famous characters of Marvel and Eddie. According to the manager of Rod Smallwood, the collaboration was a dream come true, joining the band's mascot to the group of pop culture superheroes such as X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Venom, Thanos, Thor or Deadpool.[436]

Iron Maiden became famous from its huge and constantly growing merchandising offer, which is also one of the most characteristic on the market. The beginnings of the group's activity in this field can be traced back to mid-1979, when Keith Wilford, a declared fan of the band, became the president of FC Iron Maiden and was the first to decide to create T-shirts with a characteristic logo. The avalanche of ideas began at the turn of 1979/1980, when the visual artist Derek Riggs, at the request of the manager Rod Smallwood, created the character of a macabre mascot named Eddie The Head, in the long term stimulating the possibility of a multi-threaded continuation of the band's multimedia promotion, using this very characteristic character. Since then, Eddie has been an integral part of the stage and media image of the group, being the hero of the graphics decorating almost every release and accompanying the projects that the musicians of the formation endorse. Both the managerial activities and the influence of the team's management on the creation of the merchandising offer are considered pioneering and groundbreaking in the context of the entire genre. To a large extent, thanks to skillfully created merchandising, Iron Maiden became regarded as the greatest metal band in the world in the mid-1980s.[437]

Regardless of the numerous controversies that the image of Iron Maiden aroused over the next decades, the merchandising offer created on its basis is one of the most impressive in history. As a whole, it includes several thousand versions of all possible gadgets, releases and other products, along with their reissues, on which the logo of the British formation has appeared over the past several decades. Its diversity and versatility can be compared with the no less impressive offer of the American group KISS.[438][439] According to Enrique Campos, stylist, creative manager and fashion expert: "Eddie T-shirts can be seen everywhere and on all people, even those who have never heard the band's music. Rock is associated with being 'bad', with life on the sidelines. Concepts that part of the public likes to join from time to time, which is why you see chic girls from the Salamanca District wearing their T-shirts".[440]

With the launch of alcoholic products with the group's logo on the market, a wide range of gadgets related to the culture of consumption, bar decor, product storage appeared, including proposals for glassware, dishes and brewing accessories dedicated to the group. The group's official store contains only a small part of the offer, but it is usually divided into several thematic panels, allowing for selective search for product proposals depending on the selected category from the global offer. On the global market, the group's products are available from the best distributors of music gadgets. The group's gadgets were created in cooperation with such market tycoons as Bravado, NECA, Stern Pinball, Incendium, Super7, Nodding Frog, Global Merchandising Services, Funko Pop, EMP, Rock Merch, Backstreet Merch, CMON and many others.[441][442][439] In cooperation with the American tycoon CMON, board game sets compatible with the offers of Zombicide, Ankh, Kthulhu, Massive Darkness, Rising Sun were created, which are a tribute to the group's mascot - Eddie, described by the publisher as "The Greatest Heavy Metal Icon of All Time". The sets contained miniatures referring to individual incarnations of the mascot known from the group's publications, which could be used in dedicated board games, also in limited editions. It was the first such a wide offer related to a heavy metal artist.[443][444][445] In 2023, a special version of the legendary board game Monopoly dedicated to the British formation was released worldwide. Published by USAopoly (The Op Games), "Iron Maiden Monopoly" led through the logistical realities of the largest tours in the history of the formation, allowing the choice of venues, hotels, instruments, means of transport and concert scenery. Iron Maiden joined such artists as ABBA, Queen, Metallica, AC/DC, David Bowie, KISS, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, to whom the official versions of Monopoly were dedicated.[446][447][448][449]

In 2016, the group launched a mobile game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast[361] and a pinball game with the same name in 2018. The game has been No. 1 mobile RPG in multiple markets, with over four million players worldwide having downloaded the game.[363] Inspired by the game's title, the band would undertake the Legacy of the Beast World Tour, commencing in Europe in 2018 with North and South American shows following in 2019.[364] Finnish computer game developers Rovio Entertainment have teamed up with the management of Iron Maiden to include Eddie's group mascot as one of the characters creating a special instalment of the game "Angry Birds Evolution", related to the Halloween celebration in 2017. Cooperation with the creators of the game Angry Birds, which has a multi-million audience of users around the world, meant that potentially many of them got a chance to initiate into the world of heavy metal.[450] In May 2019, the band filed a $2 million lawsuit against video game company 3D Realms for infringing on their trademark via the planned release of a game called Ion Maiden, which the band claims "is nearly identical to the Iron Maiden trademark in appearance, sound and overall commercial impression." The suit further accuses 3D Realms of causing "confusion among consumers" by depicting a skull icon similar to the band's Eddie mascot and that Ion Maiden is similar to the band's own Legacy of the Beast video game.[451]

Since 2021, Iron Maiden have welcomed in-game collaborations with the other rock and metal artists. As the first came Amon Amarth with a playable Viking Berserker character, followed by the ethereal Shadow Sorceress, which represented Lacuna Coil's frontwoman Cristina Scabbia and next step was Papa Emeritus of Ghost entering the arena. In 2022, Disturbed's mascot The Guy was brought into battle with mysterious dark powers in the Legacy of the Beast mobile game.[452] Iron Maiden teamed up with German power metal band, Powerwolf, to bring the Battle with Vârcolac (the werewolf) in games character showcase event: Macht Der Wölfe (Power of the Wolf)[453] Queen Beast is the next character appearing in the game, created with collaboration with Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy.[454] On 18 October 2022 Iron Maiden teamed up with Avenged Sevenfold's Deathbats Club for another in-game collaboration.[455] In March 2023, the band established cooperation with the management of the Motörhead formation, the fruit of cooperation became the character of Snaggletooth in the game, known from the covers of Lemmy Kilmister's band albums.[456]

The huge puppet with the image of Eddie has appeared many times during the carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro and other South American cities, among other installations resembling the most famous stars of the stage, film, sports and influential personalities of world politics.[457] During the Cavalcade of Magi 2021 in the Spanish city of Cadiz, next to dolls representing characters known from the world of pop culture, there was a huge, inflatable mummy inspired by the characteristic image of the Iron Maiden mascot from 1985.[458][459][460] In addition to a wide range of widely available gadgets, the protagonist of which were the subsequent incarnations of the band's mascot, the image of Eddie turned out to be a popular theme for tattoos adorning various parts of the body of thousands of fans of SF / Fantasy aesthetics and heavy varieties of rock music.[461]

Over the course of several decades, the band's cover illustrations and iconography have appeared in various TV productions, music videos by artists representing popular music in the broad sense, and in press publications. The distinctive cover illustrations, especially the group's mascot and logo, have become part of celebrity clothing (especially t-shirts) worn privately, as well as at prestigious industry events, including fashion shows.[462] Among hundreds of others can be found: Lady Gaga, Paris Hilton, Rihanna, Madonna, Rowan Atkinson, Taylor Swift, Taylor Hill, Selena Gomez, David Beckham, David Hasselhoff, Diego Maradona, Kelly Rowland, Taryn Manning, Olivia Munn, Travis Scott, Cameron Diaz, Dolph Ziggler, Justin Bieber, Hilary Duff, Kirsten Dunst, Nicole Kidman, Drew Barrymore, Charlize Theron, Lindsay Lohan, Miley Cyrus, Holly Madison, David Banks, Jaden Smith, Michael Fassbender, Sam Worthington, Taylor Momsen, Kat Von D, Keith Urban, Amy Poehler, Paul Gascoigne, Marc Overmars, Faustino Asprilla, Juicy J, Kourtney Kardashian, DJ Mustard, Odell Beckham Jr, Ann Sydney, Kylie Jenner, Benicio del Toro, Pilar Rubio, Slaven Bilić, Pablo Zabaleta, Anushka Sharma, Terry Butcher, Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, Paul Mariner, Stuart Pearce, Iggy Azalea, Bjorn Einar Romoren.[463][464][465]


Iron Maiden logotype and font
Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP. The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth,[466] also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.[467] Metal Lord / Iron Maiden, a characteristic font known from the group's classic logo, disseminated around the world by graphic works related to the band's activities, has found its way into pop culture for good, becoming a motif commonly used to create various logos and inscriptions.[468] The band's characteristic graphic motifs have appeared on huge stadium banners many times during football games in many countries around the world.[469] The song "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" (from Monty Python's Life of Brian) is a staple at their concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.[470]

At the beginning of January 2021, at general audience in Aula Paolo VI, Pope Francis was honoured with a circus show presented by 25 artists of Ronny Roller Circus, accompanied, among others, by presentation of the classic piece "The Trooper". It was the first time in history when a composition by a heavy metal artist was sounded in the Vatican.[471][472][473] BMW in collaboration with Motorrad Bögel GmbH has created a customized model of the IRON R18 motorcycle inspired by Iron Maiden's unique musical and visual style.[474][475] The German foundation, which aims to help young people with mental health problems, was named "Run to the Hills" after one of Iron Maiden's greatest hits. According to the president of the institution, the slogan "Run to the Hills" is about motivating people to overcome personal difficulties.[476]

Influence on other artists and the genre
Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley noted that Iron Maiden "have helped spawn an entire genre of music" and influenced literally thousands of other artists.[34][32] According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has "influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold,"[477] with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich commenting that he has "always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them."[478] Ulrich has frequently cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career.[479] Metallica's guitarist Kirk Hammett described the cover of Iron Maiden's debut LP as his favourite album cover and stated that the song "Phantom of the Opera" from that album played an important role in his development as a guitarist. Hammett explained how "(...) a lot of guitar elements from that song can still be heard in his work with Metallica today".[480] Jason Newsted, ex-bassist of Metallica, named two bands he believed made Metallica's success possible: AC/DC and Iron Maiden.[481] Kerry King of Slayer stated that "they meant so much to [him] in their early days".[482] Two of the founding members of Anthrax, guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Danny Lilker, have also cited Iron Maiden as one of the band's main influences and inspirations (especially early on in their career), the former going on to say that "they had a major impact on [his] life."[482][483] Megadeth have cited Iron Maiden as one of their biggest inspiration on many different levels.[484] Members of Testament have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their blueprint bands and have covered their songs many times.[485] Exodus guitarist Gary Holt and late singer Paul Baloff have also acknowledged Iron Maiden as one of the band's influences, with the former citing both them and Judas Priest as "basically the calibre of the stuff [he] listened to" in Exodus' early years.[486][487] Kurt Cobain, late founder, composer, vocalist and guitarist of Nirvana, was a big fan of Iron Maiden.[488] Both former and current members of Suicidal Tendencies have also mentioned Iron Maiden as one of the sources of inspiration behind their music.[489][490] Alice in Chains musicians mentioned about Iron Maiden's influences on them.[491]

Tobias Forge, frontman and leader of Swedish rock band Ghost stated that "for me personally, they have been very influential musically, I've always listened to them a lot growing up as a metal fan. Their live album, Live After Death, had — and still has — a great impact on me when it comes to work ethic. Going through that book that came with the record, watching all those dates. When I was a kid, I would sit there with a map book and pin out all the cities they played on that tour. It was like a hundred shows all over America. The show was so over the top, so it set a standard. "[Iron] Maiden was one of the big movers when it came to '80s heavy metal merchandise. All of our merchandise has always been inspired by bands like Maiden. That's the sort of idea I had about rock and roll merchandise."[492][493][494] Ville Valo, the former singer of the Finnish metal band HIM, stated that the Somewhere on Tour 1986 in Helsinki show was the first he attended and the kind of spectacle made an immense impression on him. Iron Maiden's repertoire inspired Valo to write his own music and perform live before his own audience.[495]

M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden "are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist".[478] Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor said that "Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks",[414] while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.[496] Viking metallers of Swedish band Amon Amarth stated Iron Maiden is one of their biggest influence also participated in Iron Maiden's Legacy of the Beast RPG game project.[363] Chris Impellitteri stated Iron Maiden have influenced "virtually every heavy metal band in existence with their music, brand, and of course talent!"[497]

Matt Bellamy, frontman of the English rock band Muse, revealed his love and great respect for Steve Harris' band: "(...) Iron Maiden were the British band and also felt a bit more punk rock in ways. The song "Phantom Of The Opera" [from Iron Maiden's self-titled debut album] doesn't feel as bloated or overtly classical as other metal songs. There's still something quite angry and scary about it. That's why Maiden are a band we've always looked up to. That usage of the harmonic minor scale and the progressive approach to arrangements is something that we share, even if we never sounded like them and live in a different genre. We have a lot of respect for them as musicians, especially Steve Harris, who is one of the best bass players around."[498]

Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante stated Iron Maiden "made every band that were influenced by them aspire to be like them. When I was learning to play guitar, this was one of the tunes I practiced. I developed as a guitar player and my coordination got better and better. Maiden had something different, they brought out that Primal roar from us. This was a New style of Hard Rock and Metal, they had a Punk Drive to them with Boston styled Guitar licks, they changed the game. I often said, no Maiden, no Big 4."[499] Rafael Bittencourt, the guitarist of Brazilian heavy metal band Angra, praised Iron Maiden as the band which finally defined power metal style.[500] Brendon Small, an American musician, stand-up comedian, animator, writer, producer and the actor, known for co-creating the animated series Home Movies and Metalocalypse, was inspired by Iron Maiden music and iconography.[501]

Employed to Serve's Sammy Urwin stated: "(...) their influence is absolutely huge, Maiden are a funny one. They're the one that seems to stick out for people, especially in the hardcore scene. Everyone is into Sabbath and Priest, but Maiden can be the Marmite one of the three. But they've influenced so much metalcore. Everyone from Prayer For Cleansing, Unearth and Darkest Hour – the influence of records like The Number Of The Beast on bands like that is undeniable. Not just influential on a musical level, The Number Of The Beast is as much a part of heavy music culture as it is a straightforward, mandatory soundtrack for diehard metalheads. In fact, the album has transcended its heavy metal origins and passed into the broader mainstream."[502]

Famous pop singer Lady Gaga stated she admires what Iron Maiden have achieved in their career and aims to follow in their path. "The devotion of the fans moving in unison, pumping their fists, watching the show, when I see that, I see the paradigm for my future and the relationship I want to have with my fans. Iron Maiden's never had a hit song, and they tour stadiums around the world, and their fans live, breathe and die for Maiden, and that is my dream. That is my dream."[503] Miley Cyrus stated that Steve Harris's band is one of her favorites and the band's music has had a significant impact on shaping her taste in music.[504] Chuck D, founder of the iconic rap group Public Enemy, admits: "The whole idea for the Public Enemy concept album began with our amazement that bands like Iron Maiden were able to include a number of messages and details on the covers of their albums."[505]

Joakim Broden, songwriter who is the lead vocalist, keyboardist, and occasional third guitarist of the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton, stated Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast "is an album that defines an entire music genre". Band's formula secret is about "taking the energy of punk and put it into heavy metal without losing any of what made metal great."[506] Joe Parrish, the guitarist of British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, cites Iron Maiden as a lasting inspiration that introduced him to the world of heavy music. This fascination left a permanent mark on his playing style and influenced the formation of his musical taste.[507]

Johnny Cash, an American country musician, singer and actor, has repeatedly expressed his respect for heavy metal performers, in particular Iron Maiden and Metallica.[508] Chris Shiflett best known from playing in Foo Fighters, recalled his time of adolescence when Iron Maiden were "the Gods" for him and the form of initiation into the world of much heavier music.[509] Christian Jost aka. Falk Maria Schlegel the founding member of Powerwolf band revealed that Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind album combines the elements making heavy metal what it is today. According to him some of the genre's aspects are visual gloom, a bit of melancholy mixed with a lot of power and pure energy. As the musician said: "Mr. Steve Harris and Iron Maiden are the reasons why I wanted to form a band to play heavy metal."[510] Tracii Guns, co-founder of Guns N' Roses and frontman of L.A. Guns considered the Killers album to be one of the releases that completely changed his life. The musician described Iron Maiden's proposal as a hybrid of hard rock in the Thin Lizzy style with punk fierceness, energy and high-octane heavy metal, which was a new quality at the time of publication.[511]

Miho Rosana, the former bass player of Japanese metal band Lovebites, described her respect to Iron Maiden and their eponymous debut album in a few sentences: "(...) Iron Maiden's self-titled debut is the greatest album of the last 50 years. It is important because of its unprecedented sound. It saw progressive metal sounds fused with the aggression of punk, and in doing so became the cornerstone of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. Truly an iconic album in every way. You can hear Iron Maiden's influence in so much metal that followed and even in new bands today. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that without them, today's metal scene would be very different."[512]

Other artists who cite the band as an influence include Chris Jericho, a professional wrestler and lead singer of Fozzy,[513] multi-instrumentalist Twiggy Ramirez (Marilyn Manson, A Perfect Circle, Nine Inch Nails),[514] Myles Kennedy an American musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the rock band Alter Bridge, and as the lead vocalist in guitarist Slash's backing band,[515] guitarist Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Guns N' Roses, Nine Inch Nails, Alanis Morissette),[516] Serj Tankian, frontman of System of a Down,[517] Zoltan Bathory, the guitarist of Five Finger Death Punch,[518] musicians of an American heavy metal band Lamb of God,[519] David Vincent and Steve Tucker of Morbid Angel,[520] Lee Altus of Exodus and Heathen,[521] musicians of American progressive metal band Mastodon,[522] Tom Morello, the lead guitarist of RATM and Audioslave,[523] Cam Pipes, lead vocalist of 3 Inches of Blood,[524] Joey Vera bassist of Armored Saint,[525] Vitaly Dubinin, bassist of Aria,[526] Michel Langevin, founding member and drummer of Voivod,[527] Mille Petrozza, vocalist and lead guitarist of Kreator,[528] Marcel Schirmer of German thrash metal band Destruction,[529] Chuck Schuldiner, late frontman, founder and guitarist of Death,[530] Paul Allender, guitarist of British extreme metallers Cradle of Filth,[531] Adam Nergal Darski, co-founder, frontman, composer and the lead guitarist of Polish blackened death metal band Behemoth,[532] David Draiman, the vocalist of American band Disturbed,[533] Ihsahn, composer, vocalist and lead guitarist of Emperor,[534] musicians of German power metal band Helloween,[535] American metal band Machine Head,[536] Washington-based band the Melvins,[537] Bay Area thrash metal band Death Angel,[538] American progressive metal band Fates Warning,[539] Canadian rock band Sum 41,[540] American rock band Skid Row,[541] American heavy metal bands Sanctuary and Nevermore,[542] Paul Gilbert, co-founder of Mr. Big band,[543] Jon Schaffer, the rhythm guitarist and principal songwriter of the Florida-based heavy metal band Iced Earth,[544] Mikael Åkerfeldt, guitarist and lead vocalist of Opeth,[545] and X Japan drummer Yoshiki and former guitarist hide.[546][547] Andreas Kisser and Max Cavalera of Brazilian metal band Sepultura.[548][549] Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine,[550] American rock band My Chemical Romance,[551] musicians of Sentenced,[552] Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil,[553] Ville Valo, the frontman of HIM,[554] also musicians of Amorphis[555] and Therion.[556] Both current and former Dream Theater members John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their biggest influences.[557] Kat Von D a Mexican-American tattoo artist, model, entrepreneur and recording artist was influenced by the band.[558] Franck Hueso better known as Carpenter Brut listed Iron Maiden's second album Killers among ten records which changed his life.[559] Lorenzo Raganzini a techno musician and the performer who uses remixes of metal music including Iron Maiden's classics, described the band as one of his greatest inspirations.[560]

Musicians of Rotting Christ,[568] Varathron,[569] Necromantia,[570] or Yoth Iria have been stating about English formation has influenced on them.[571] Polish heavy metal pioneers Turbo many times have mentioned about Iron Maiden being one of their biggest influences to date. The band's second album Smak ciszy (1985) was officially dedicated to Iron Maiden. A few decades later Turbo musicians supported live former Maiden's frontman Paul Di'Anno.[572] The 35th anniversary of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son iconic album premiere turned out to be an impulse to create the collective project The Legacy - A Tribute To Iron Maiden, for which the musicians of the Polish groups called CETI and Wolf Spider were responsible.[573]

Brian Slagel, the owner of Metal Blade Records, stated: "The Number Of The Beast, to me, still to this day, is the perfect heavy metal album. Everything is perfect. The sound is perfect, the songs are perfect, the lyrics are perfect. It's the ultimate heavy metal album and it checks off all the boxes. Forty years on, the influence of The Number Of The Beast can be heard in a vast array of contemporary heaviness, and it might be quicker to list notable metal musicians who don't cite the record as an inspiration. For me it along a time when I was really heavily getting into the whole metal thing. I was starting my record company and it was a pivotal point in my life, and which determined what I would do for the rest of it! Maiden motivated me to do whatever I could to make other people hear this amazing music. It was a life-changing experience."[502]

As noticed music journalist Geoff Barton, the band's music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school of the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm 'n blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism.[623] According to Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed.[624] As stated the former editor of the German magazine Rock Hard, Götz Kühnemund, Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they're an intrinsically heavy metal group. It is equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, hard rock – almost every genre. Iron Maiden took hard rock from the '70s, took it into the' 80s, and created a new genre that didn't exist before. This band introduced a DIY approach to all rock music. They even more than all the others popularised guitar harmonies in metal. Many metal bands in existence today have two guitarists, who use double guitar harmonies, and that's where they are inspired by Iron Maiden.[625]

In the article published by Rolling Stone magazine the journalists exposed the role which band played in process of re-definiting the genre, noticed Iron Maiden's debut album from 1980 was the proof of constant "expanding of vocabularies of metal and, by proxy, rock." As the authors said, in "The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll" music critic Lester Bangs has described metal as "the aural image of a battering ram" and stated "as the Seventies drew to a close, it appeared that heavy metal had it, before directing readers to the nascent punk scene." Mentioned book came out in the beginning of 1980, so Bangs couldn't hear Iron Maiden, "who sounded not just like a battering ram, but also a fighter jet, a thousand charging horses, and an air-raid siren all at the same time." Cited article includes conclusion refering to the band's lyrical context which always has been full of true emotions, supercharged sense of positive vibrations, resilence, dramatic background in opposition to the 'doom and gloom' lyrics of genere's pioneers as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest or Cream. Iron Maiden's music became the journey throught the progressive structores of the songs as a kind of the race on the adrenaline's rush. Rolling Stone eventually recapitulated band's characteristics based on "innovation, dedication to their craft, influence, and complete refusal to compromise their artistry. They are musical visionaries in the same league as Pink Floyd, Queen, U2, and even the Beatles — just louder."[626]

Jörg Pistorius, German music journalist, stated there is: "No single band can claim to have created or invented heavy metal. However, there is one that shaped it and was largely responsible for making it a globally recognized style and market segment with high sales potential. (...) Iron Maiden played fast guitar figures sparkling with energy, combined with harmonious melodies and choruses that could be sung immediately. No band has shaped heavy metal as much as Iron Maiden."[627]

Ian Christe, the Swiss musician, music journalist and an author of a publication titled Sound of the Beast claimed Iron Maiden are responsible for the further development of the genre, carried out under the aegis of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. As he claimed, Iron Maiden, together with Judas Priest, are responsible for the greatest development of the metal genre. While AC/DC and Black Sabbath remained primal and dark, it was Iron Maiden and Judas Priest who transformed the twin guitar harmonies, creating a whole new quality.[628]

According to music journalist and the writer Neil Daniels Iron Maiden "redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. Band's influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist."[33] From the artist's profile published by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame it appears that "in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands – creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour."[629]

Former guitarist and co-founder of Judas Priest band, K.K. Downing, said that while Iron Maiden's "music does not quite suit my taste, I cannot deny that it has had a great influence on heavy metal and music in general. As a Brit, I am terribly proud of what they have managed over the years to fill the niche they have created. Besides, I have always admired them for being able to achieve such a great commercial success for their marketing activities."[630]

Steve Harris is considered one of the most influential musicians and composers in heavy rock history. He is the author of the majority of Iron Maiden's repertoire and the creator of an archetypal composition pattern in modern metal. In addition to writing riffs, vocal melodies and lyrics for most songs, he is also involved in audio-visual production and editing. The riffs created by him are among the most unforgettable in history, as evidenced by compositions such as "The Trooper", "The Number of the Beast", "Phantom of the Opera", "Run to the Hills", "Fear of the Dark" or "Hallowed Be Thy Name". The creator of Iron Maiden has been repeatedly named the best and most influential metal bassist of all time. He is also the originator of extremely expressive, galloping bass lines. His compositional style is based on triplets consisting of sixteenths and eighth notes, creating an intense rhythmic background for a double (then triple) guitar attack. Steve Harris is one of the few bass players who can play extremely fast and dense with just his fingers. According to the Ultimate Classic Rock editors "technically it was incredibly impressive to achieve so much speed and dynamics in the sound without using a standard pick". The founder of Iron Maiden inspired many other musicians, including such thrash metal bassists as Frankie Bello of Anthrax, former Metallica bassists Cliff Burton, Jason Newsted, and current Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo.[631]

Appearance in media
The first heavy metal videos in history broadcast by MTV were the images for the live versions of "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" taken from official VHS Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden).[632][633] The song "Flash of the Blade" was included on the soundtrack of Dario Argento's 1985 horror film Phenomena (AKA "Creepers") and was covered by the American band Avenged Sevenfold on their double live album/DVD Live in the LBC & Diamonds in the Rough. Rhapsody of Fire have also recorded a cover of the song that is featured on the deluxe edition of their album From Chaos to Eternity. "Flash of the Blade" can also be heard in the Jem and the Holograms episode "Kimber's Rebellion", just after the cartoon band members return home from Paris, on a boom-box stereo being carried by a passerby.[92]

In 1989, Iron Maiden's musicians took part in the Rock Aid Armenia project (also known as Live Aid Armenia) - a humanitarian aid from the British music industry. The aim of the project was to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in Armenia in 1988.[634] The enterprise was promoted by a single with a new version of the Deep Purple hit song "Smoke on the Water", whose recording included, apart from some Deep Purple musicians, performers known from their solo careers and from other bands including: Bryan Adams, Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Geoff Downes and Chris Squire (Yes), Keith Emerson, David Gilmour (Pink Floyd), Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Alex Lifeson (Rush), Brian May and Roger Taylor (Queen), Paul Rodgers.[635] In 1990 the song was included on The Earthquake Album and on The Earthquake Video. Four versions of the song (including one from 2010) were released in the form of Smoke on the Water: Metropolis Sessions in 2010. The original release turned out to be a first ever UK's Gold-awarded charity album.[636] Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain also took part in the recording of a special version of Led Zeppelin's song called "Rock 'n Roll".[637] In addition to the single and the album, a set of music videos of individual formations participating in the project and a documentary film about the tragic events of 1988 were also prepared. The continuation of the initiative from 1989 became the WhoCares project, which involved: Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Ian Gillan, Jon Lord (Deep Purple), Nicko McBrain (Iron Maiden), Jason Newsted (ex-Metallica) and Mikko Lindstrom (HIM).[638]

The band's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs, such as the singles "Teenage Dirtbag" by Wheatus,[639] "Back to the 80's" by Danish dance-pop band Aqua.[640] and "Fat Lip" by Sum 41.[641] Iron Maiden have also been referenced in Weezer's "Heart Songs" (from their 2008 self-titled "Red" album),[642] Blues Traveller's "Psycho Joe" (from 1997's Straight on till Morning),[643] and NOFX's "Eddie, Bruce and Paul" (from their 2009 album Coaster), which Sputnikmusic describes as "a humorous retelling of Paul DiAnno's departure".[644] An American alternative country rock performer Ryan Adams included his own interpretation of the classic Iron Maiden song "Wasted Years" on the soundtrack to the series Californication Season 6. This was a personal tribute to the band responsible for his initiation into the world of heavy metal music.[645]

The number of releases in tribute to the British formation can be estimated in the hundreds. The reinterpretations of the band's achievements include an extremely wide range of stylistic variants, such as: numerous sub-genres of rock and metal, soul, pop, classics, symphonic music, alternative music, electro, techno, industrial, hip-hop, rap, reggae, ska, jazz, chorales, pastiches, piano music, early music, string music, early music or acoustic versions with a wide range of classical instruments.[646][647] In 2008, Kerrang! released Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden, an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Trivium, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.[478] In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, Threshold and Within Temptation, released Mind the Acoustic Pieces, a re-interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album.[648] As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano,[649] electro,[650] string quartet[651] and hip-hop tributes among many others.[652]

Iron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, including Carmageddon 2,[653] Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,[654] Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City,[655] Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned,[656] Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,[657] Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,[658] SSX on Tour[659] and Madden NFL 10.[660] Their music also appears in the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series of rhythmic video games.[661] The U.S. shooter game entitled PowerSlave was a reference to the Iron Maiden's album of the same name, released In 1984, which also features an Egyptian-themed cover.[662][663]

Transformers author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references, including song lyrics and the phrase "Up the Irons" in his books, including The Ark series and The AllSpark Almanac series.[664] Iron Maiden music, lyrics, themes, fans and iconography have appeared in many episodes and movies including quasi-documentary comedies as Schemers,[665] The Night of the Beast[666] also in documentary movies such as Global Metal[667] or band's own Flight 666 among many others.[668] Iron Maiden songs have also appeared in films such as Murder by Numbers;[669] while MTV's animated duo Beavis and Butt-Head have commented favourably on the band several times.[670] "The Trooper" song and elements of the band's image appeared in a youth musical comedy entitled Metal Lords broadcast on Netflix.[671] Numerous threads referring to the history of Iron Maiden and the role of the group in shaping the genre were included in individual episodes of the series Stranger Things (the character of Eddie Munson, recordings, presented releases and graphics),[672] while the music of the group was included in the soundtrack of the production of The Terminal List.[673] Stranger Things: Flight of Icarus is a book inspired by one of Iron Maiden's songs: "Flight of Icarus". The story is based on the series including the main character, Eddie Munson, an archetypical metalhead and avid fan of the British band.[674] On 17 November 2022, German television mogul ARD broadcast a series of documentaries entitled How Heavy Metal Saved My Life about the role of music in the lives of fans. One of the episodes was dedicated to Iron Maiden fans.[675]

Bruce Dickinson is the member of the band most active in media. The Iron Maiden frontman presented Bruce Dickinson's Friday Rock Show on BBC radio station 6 Music from 2002 to 2010.[676] In addition to his show on 6 Music, Dickinson also hosted a series entitled Masters of Rock on BBC Radio 2 from 2003 to 2007.[677] His singing and episode acting were presented in The Club Paradise,[678] Mr. Bean's Elected,[679] and A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child[680] Dickinson's aviation passion and storytelling talent were reflected in Flying Heavy Metal (Discovery Series) among many other documents.[681] Bruce Dickinson was the main character of the Psycho Schizo Espresso podcast, which was published on social platforms. The topics of individual episodes were phenomena that could not be explained in a rational way. The interviews with controversial people were also broadcast.[682]

In 2023 Netflix aired the animated series BASTARD!! - Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy, which takes place in different worlds of heavy metal music. One of them is called "Maiden World" referring to the British band.[683] A very special Thunderflix platform created by Samuel Douek has appeared on the multimedia market, which was a kind of audio-visual music library dedicated to the world’s famous heavy rock performers. The application called "Metal Netflix" has brought multi-format HD footage available worldwide. One of the main heroes of the offer is Iron Maiden.[684]

Claims of Satanic references
In 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.[119] The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.[685] The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.[200]

Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video.[148] Steve Harris has since commented that, "It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists."[117] Harris has also stated that "The Number of the Beast" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II,[686] and also influenced by Robert Burns' "Tam o' Shanter".[120] Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.[687]

Ed Force One

For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport.[688] The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically.[286] It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery,[286] which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.[689]

The aircraft, named "Ed Force One" after a competition on the band's website,[287] was flown by Dickinson, as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus, and plays a major role in the award-winning documentary[690] Iron Maiden: Flight 666, which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009.[300] A different aeroplane (registered G-STRX)[691] was used for The Final Frontier World Tour in 2011 with altered livery, adopting the artwork of The Final Frontier album,[692] and features heavily in the 2012 documentary "Behind the Beast".

For The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-Air France Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, supplied by Air Atlanta Icelandic (registered TF-AAK)[693] and customised by Volga-Dnepr Gulf,[694] which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.[357] In January 2022, Bruce Dickinson told the Associated Press that he would not be piloting band's plane on their upcoming tour citing his nearing the mandatory age limit for commercial airline pilots. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), commercial pilots must retire at age 65. However, there is currently no maximum age limit for being a private pilot or for being an Air Force pilot.[695]

Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter,[696] has stated his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen and Wishbone Ash.[697] In 2010 Harris said, "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it."[477] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's "heaviness" was inspired by "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in."[698] Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as "more like a rhythm guitar,"[699] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style,[700] heard in such songs as "The Trooper"[701] and "Run to the Hills."[702]

The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing styles. Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, "evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing."[703] Stating that he "was inspired by blues rock rather than metal," Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a "melodic player."[704] Janick Gers prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore,[705] which he claims is in contrast to Smith's "rhythmic" sound.[706]

Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,[707] has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan,[708] and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.[709] Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the Dance of Death album,[710] Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, "Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns."[711]

Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, although the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time,[187] keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,[163] and an attempt to return to the "stripped down" production of their earlier material on 1990's No Prayer for the Dying marked some experimentation.[186] In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs,[712] which Steve Harris describes as not progressive "in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way".[713] According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was "more progressive",[714] and they would return to this style in 1995's The X Factor, which he states is "like an extension of Seventh Son..., in the sense of the progressive element to it".[213] The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,[477] which AllMusic states was "clearly drawing from elements of punk rock",[715] although Harris firmly denies this.[716]

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic was a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first three confirmed cases in the Czech Republic were reported on 1 March 2020. On 12 March, the government declared a state of emergency, for the first time in the country's modern history for the area of the entire country. On 16 March, the country closed its borders, forbade the entry of foreigners without residence permits, and issued a nationwide curfew. While originally planned to be in effect until 24 March, the measures were later extended until 1 April[3][4] and then again until the end of State of Emergency[5] which was extended by the Chamber of Deputies until 30 April 2020[6] and then again until 17 May 2020.

Some measures undertaken by the Czech Republic differed in key aspects from other countries. A general curfew was in place between 16 March and 24 April, although with numerous exemptions. Apart from the permitting essential shopping and going to and from work, as in other countries, it also permitted visiting relatives and allowed for unrestricted movement in parks and open countryside.[7] A general closure of services and retail sale was in place from 14 March until 11 May; however, all shops could conduct socially-distances sales with delivery through makeshift takeout windows and the gradual opening of selected shops started in several waves from 24 March onwards.[8] Fear, anger, and hopelessness were the most frequent traumatic emotional responses in the general public during the first COVID-19 outbreak in the Czech Republic.[9] The four most frequent categories of fear were determined: fear of the negative impact on household finances, fear of the negative impact on the household finances of significant others, fear of the unavailability of health care, and fear of an insufficient food supply.[9] The government did not order the closure of manufacturing plants, but many did so voluntarily during the second half of March, with Hyundai spearheading a gradual reopening from 14 April.[10][11]

The Czech Republic was the first[12] European country to make the wearing of face masks mandatory from 19 March onwards.[13] COVID-19 testing was made widely available with drive-through locations from 14 March,[14] and from 27 March anyone with a fever, dry cough or shortness of breath was eligible for a free test.[15] From 13 April onwards, COVID-19 testing capacity significantly surpassed demand.[16] Contact tracing in the country also included voluntary disclosure of mobile phone position and debit card payments data for previous days and the quarantining of identified contacts.[17] By 1 May 2020, altogether 257 COVID-19-related deaths were identified in the Czech Republic compared to 2,719 in similarly populous Sweden, which did not impose a full lockdown. However, Belgium, also with a similar population, had had 7,866 deaths at that time, despite having implemented an early and strict lockdown. The Czech Republic started gradually easing measures from 7 April 2020 onwards,[5][18] with most restrictions being lifted by 11 May 2020. However, by 17 November 2020, the Czech Republic had recorded a total of 6,416 COVID-19-related deaths compared to 6,344 in Sweden, surpassing Sweden's deaths count.[citation needed] By August 2021, the Czech Republic has recorded the fourth highest confirmed death rate in the world. There are some root causes speculated. A lockdown was decided in November 2020.[citation needed]

There was an ongoing discussion about vaccinations and its efficiency in the Czech public space. A 2022 study published in the Scientific Reports has shown the registered numbers of deaths in the Czech Republis is approx. “3.5 times lower than it would be expected without vaccination”. Authors of the study thus concluded that “vaccination is more effective in saving lives than suggested by simplistic comparisons”.[19][20]

Background
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[21][22]

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[23][24] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[25][23]

28 February – As of 28 February 170 suspected cases were tested with negative results. 307 people were in home quarantine imposed by a regional health authority, 77 of them were in South Bohemian Region.[2]

1 March – The Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, reported that three cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory.[26] The three cases are treated at the Bulovka Hospital in Prague; one of the cases had been found in Ústí nad Labem, but was transported to the Bulovka Hospital.[26] All cases were connected with northern Italy. One case was a man who returned from a conference in Udine, the second case was a woman (tourist, U.S. citizen) studying in Milan and the third case was a man who returned from a skiing holiday in Auronzo di Cadore.[27][28]

Week 10 (2–8 March)
2 March – Another case was confirmed, a woman who was on skiing holiday in Auronzo di Cadore and was staying in the same hotel as the man from a previous case.[29]

3 March – Another case was reported, a woman from Ecuador studying in Milano, a friend of the U.S. tourist who tested positive several days prior.[30] Government started taking active measures (see policies section below).

5 March – Four new cases were identified a Czech and an Italian who returned from Italy by the end of February, third was related to case No. 3 and fourth was related to case No. 6.[31]

6 March – Obligatory 14 days' quarantine for people returning from selected parts of Italy announced (see policies section below).[32][33] As of 6 March 1,011 people were already in home quarantine imposed by regional health authority, 341 of them in Prague, 160 in South Bohemian Region and 63 in Central Bohemian Region.[2] As of 6 March, some 16,500 Czechs were in Italy;[34] spring break falls between early February and the middle of March 2020.

Week 11 (9–15 March)
9 March – Bulovka Hospital in Prague has announced that all but two tourists (from U.S. – case No. 2 and from Ecuador – case #5) have been released to home quarantine.[35]

10 March – Positive cases were being identified in ever increasing number of regions.[36]

11 March – Schools closed.[37]

12 March – The Czech government has declared a state of emergency for 30 days and adopted a number of measures (see policies section below).[38][39]

13 March – Brno University Hospital (a COVID-19 testing center) was hacked, disrupting services.[40][41]

15 March – Shortly before midnight, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced approval of the nationwide quarantine (see policies section below).

Week 12 (16–22 March)
16 March – Starting at midnight, an hour after the nationwide quarantine declaration was approved the previous day, nearly 11 million Czech residents were placed under quarantine (see policies section below).[3] The Czech Republic became one of the first[42] countries in the EU to completely close its borders (with exemptions including international freight transport, see policies section below).[3] First three people were reported recovered.[43]

18 March – The Czech Republic became the first[12] country in the European Union to introduce mandatory face cover (see policies section below).[44]

21 March – Deliveries of protective gear purchased by Czech Government in China started: a heavy cargo plane Antonov An-124 Ruslan provided through NATO Support and Procurement Agency brought 100 tons of masks, respirators and coronavirus tests from China, while a China Eastern plane brought 7 million face masks.[45] This helped to alleviate the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the Czech Republic. According to Security Information Service, the shortage happened after Chinese embassy conducted massive purchases of respirators available on Czech market during January and February and transferred them to China.[46]

22 March – First death reported: a 95-year-old man.[47] While COVID-19 positive, at the time of death, the man was not at ICU and did not have pneumonia that is a COVID-19 specific type of death. The man had chronic heart issues and had also a pacemaker. The cause of death was formally established as a "complete exhaustion of organism".[48]

Week 13 (23–29 March)
23 March – The local health authority in the Moravian-Silesian Region announced that 80% of COVID-19 examinations that were conducted in the region in the previous days with use of fast-test kits that government procured and airlifted from China (altogether 300,000 kits bought by the Czech Government for total price of CZK 54 m—approximately US$2.1 m) came out wrong when double-checked through standard testing.[49][50] It was later confirmed the cause was an incorrect use where the fast-test react to an immune response and are not suitable for new patient screenings.[51]

24 March – A second death was reported: a 45-year-old man died after six days in a hospital in Havířov. The patient had had advanced cancer with metastases to multiple organs. The cause of death was established as multiple organ failure due to cancer but COVID-19 infection accelerated the patient's death.[52]

A third death was reported: a 71-year-old woman died in Všeobecná fakultní nemocnice in Prague. The woman had the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as other illnesses, so it wasn't immediately clear that she may be COVID-19 positive. Only after being hospitalised the woman informed doctors that her relative recently returned from Italy and was then tested for COVID-19. The woman was connected to a ventilator but died three days after start of hospitalisation.[53]

Apart from the Uber driver on ECMO, there were 19 other patients in hospitals in serious condition, all of them connected to ventilators.[53]

25 March – The fourth and fifth deaths were reported: The fourth death was an 82-year-old from Prague with long-term chronic health problems. The fifth patient is an 88-year-old man from the Central Bohemian Region who was at home getting treatment and had a chronic disease.[54]

A sixth patient died at Thomayer Hospital. The 75-year-old patient had diabetes and Parkinson's disease and also had advanced heart problems. The patient had been in the hospital since January and got infected while in post-operative care. After this patient tested positive for COVID-19, the hospital tested all 29 other patients in the same ward on 22 March, all negative. The test was repeated again on 25 March, this time with positive outcomes for 13 patients. Several of the hospital's staff had become infected earlier, probably while taking care of the Uber driver who would later become the first remdesivir receiver in the country. This patient was originally admitted with simple pneumonia without initial indication of COVID-19. Two of the infected nurses were hospitalised at the local pulmonary ward at the time of the sixth patient's death.[54][55]

The government was planning to evacuate Czechs from Australia and New Zealand by the end of the week. Hundreds of Czechs still remained abroad, mainly in Oceania and Southeast Asia.[54]

An Antonov An-124 Ruslan provided through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency arrived again with 24 tons of medical products purchased by the Czech government in China. The shipment included 52,600 protective suits, 70,900 protective glasses, 250,000 gloves, 1.16 million respirators and eight million masks. Further government purchased personal protection equipment shipments were planned for delivery with use of planes by the companies Smartwings and China Eastern Airlines, which were contracted for nine flights per week for six weeks in advance.[56]

Commuters
Thirty-seven thousand and 13,000 Czechs live in the Czech Republic and work in Germany and Austria, respectively, large portion of that in healthcare.[57] Cross-border workers (known as pendlers) were originally exempted from the complete travel ban. As Germany and Austria gradually became major centers of COVID-19 outbreak, the Government started tightening up rules for commuters. By 26 March, Czechs commuting to work in Austria and Germany were required to remain in those countries for at least 21 days. Upon return, they would be quarantined for 14 days. Czechs working in health, social services, and emergency services abroad were not subject to the new rules.[58][59] The rules were eased from 14 April onwards (see policies section below).

Districts bordering Germany and Austria gradually became major centers of COVID-19 outbreak in the Czech Republic. Domažlice District reached the highest number of COVID-19 positive persons relative to population size in the country. According to Vice-prime Minister Czech government avoided closing the commuter loophole because German and Austrian healthcare system in areas close to the border is dependent on Czech commuters and also because government feared it could lead Slovakia to close access to Slovak commuters working in Czech healthcare.[60][61][62]
26 March – A Taiwanese student in her twenties, who recently returned to Taiwan from the Czech Republic tested positive for coronavirus. She left the Czech Republic after 8 months in the country on 19 March 2020, announced symptoms (fever, diarrhoea) to Taiwanese authorities on 24 March and was diagnosed COVID-19 positive on 26 March 2020.[63] Thirty-four patients were in severe condition.[64]

27 March – Despite having been quarantined already for two weeks, at least six retirement homes were hit by the spread of the COVID-19 virus.[65] Authorities noted also the rising number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers.[66] As the capacity for COVID-19 testing increased, authorities eased requirements for free testing. Anyone with a fever, dry cough or shortness of breath may be eligible for a free COVID-19 test.[15]

29 March – Five people died. Among the victims was a 45-year-old nurse from Thomayer Hospital, an elderly woman from a senior home in Michle and an elderly woman from a senior home in Břevnice. There were 227 patients in hospitals, 45 of them in severe condition.[67]

Week 14 (30 March – 5 April)
30 March – In South Moravia, testing of the so-called "smart quarantine" was started: local travel history of infected persons were to be tracked using data from mobile phones and bank cards. Three hundred military personnel were deployed to reinforce local health authority for the purpose of tracing patients' contacts and collecting samples. If this approach is deemed successful by the authorities for diminishing the pandemic, the "smart quarantine" method is planned to replace the existing nationwide curfew policy.[68] The city of Uherský Brod started thorough disinfection of all common areas of apartment buildings and public areas after a significant increase in COVID-19 infections. Health authority registered thirty new cases in the town.[69] The Government also issued a decree for citizens to make cloth face masks for the nation.[70]

31 March – In a community of 72 people living in a retirement home in Litoměřice, 52 positive tests were confirmed.[71] Employees of the retirement home in Česká Kamenice decided to stay with their clients 24 hours a day until 15 April, to avoid the seniors getting COVID-19.[72]

1 April – One month ago the Czech Republic reported the first coronavirus case. A second senior from the Litoměřice retirement home died, as well as seniors from Prague and Moravia-Silesia.[73] The Department of Infectious Diseases of the Central Military Hospital in Prague has treated COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine. Eight of them have already been released for home quarantine. The evaluation of preliminary results of this therapy will be carried out in April. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were originally used to treat malaria, but at present they also help patients with autoimmune diseases—rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers these substances as one of the options to treat COVID-19.[74]

Supreme Administrative Court ruled that Government decision to postpone the Senate district 32 by-election due to COVID-19 pandemic was illegal. According to the court, the Government lacked the authority to make such a decision, as that can only be done by an Act of Parliament. The by-election to fill a seat after Jaroslav Kubera, who died of heart attack, was originally planned on 27 March and would take place on 5 June.[75]

Czech aid to other countries
China: On 17 February, a plane with 4.5 tons of personal protection equipment donated by Czech Government left from Vienna to China.[76] The plane was also loaded with Hungarian, Slovak and Austrian PPE donations to China.
China: On 1 March, a plane with 5 tons of PPE (including 780,000 pairs of gloves, 48,000 face masks and 6.800 protection suits) left from Prague to China. This time the load was donated by a multitude of parties, including President's Office, Olomouc Region, Karlovy Vary Region, South Moravian Region, Vysočina Region, the town of Třebíč and Škoda Auto.[77] The donation was too large to fit into a single plane and thus there were further flights planned. Those, however, did not take place, as China declined to accept the aid.[78]
Italy: Czech Government donated 110,000 FFP2 respirators to Italy on 23 March. This donation took place after Czech authorities confiscated 680,000 respirators from a fraudster, who was stockpiling them in a warehouse in Lovosice. According to media, 110,000 of the confiscated respirators were originally sent from China as a donation to the 300,000 strong Chinese minority that lives in Northern Italy.[79][80]
Italy, Spain: 10,000 protective suits were donated to Italy and Spain each on 26 March (delivered on 30 March).[81]
Slovenia: One million face masks and 200,000 FFP2 respirators were donated to Slovenia on 1 April 2020.[82]
France: Czech Republic offered treatment of French COVID-19 patients in serious condition. First six patients were to be airlifted from France on 6 April and placed at University Hospital in Brno.[83] On the day of the planned airlift, however, France declined the help, stating that it is now able to better deal with the pandemic on its own.[84]
North Macedonia: Czech Republic donated 1 million face masks on 12 April 2020.[85]
Foreign aid to the Czech Republic

Taiwan: Taiwan donated 25 lung ventilators to hospitals in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April 2020.[86]
Japan: Japan donated experimental drug Avigan (Favipiravir) for treatment of 20 patients with option to sell packages for further 80 patients on 9 April 2020.[87]
2 April – One victim died at the General University Hospital in Prague (VFN); another victim was a 79-year-old patient hospitalised at the Hradec Králové University Hospital.[88] The government decided to extend the border control by 20 days. Border checks with Germany and Austria will last until midnight Friday, 24 April.[89]

3 April – A public controversy has arisen around shipments of personal protective equipment that the Czech Government purchased and airlifted from China. On 31 March, Mayor of Prague Zdeněk Hřib publicly praised Government of Taiwan for donating ICU ventilators to the Czech Republic, while pointing out that all of the equipment from China was purchased, none was donated. Representatives of China's business interest in the Czech Republic countered by claiming that China donated personal protective equipment that was to be handed over to Czech hospitals on 1 April. According to the media, Czech authorities received a promise of donation of PPE; however, none have reached the country by 3 April 2020.[90]

4 April – There were 29 infected police officers in the Czech Republic, 343 more were in preventive quarantine.[91]

Week 15 (6–12 April)
6 April – Government eased a number of restrictive measures, e.g. by opening outside sporting grounds (including skiing, shooting ranges, etc.), movement in parks and nature without face masks and opening of more shops and services[citation needed] (see policies section below).

7 April – Government sought extension of the State of Emergency for 30 days, i.e. until 12 May 2020. Chamber of Deputies of Parliament granted extension until 30 April 2020.[92]

12 April – Government announced that it was preparing a plan for gradual lifting of remaining restrictions. Government aimed at reaching maximum of 400 newly infected people a day to prevent overburdening the healthcare system. Instead of general restrictions, the intended maximum number should be reached through contact tracing of positive cases (see policies section below).[93]

Week 16 (13–19 April)
13 April – Number of COVID-19 tests sank from 8,000 a day to mere 3,200 a day during Easter weekend which included also Friday and Monday as state holidays. According to health authority, testing capacity during Easter weekend significantly surpassed demand for testing from potential patients. Health authority expected the demand to rise again in the following week.[16]

14 April – A month-long complete border closure ended (see policies section below). A large number of Czech Romanis started returning from particularly hit United Kingdom, where many lived for over 15 years, leading to fear of possible increase of COVID-19 infection.[94][95]

Hyundai factory in Nošovice, which makes 1,500 cars a day including Kona Electric, restarted production after three weeks' pause. Ten days later, Government exempted Korean Hyundai "specialists and key workers" needed for ramp up of electric vehicle production from cross-border and quarantine restrictions. Manufacturing plants were unaffected by Government restrictions; however, many had decided to close voluntarily.[10][11]

The Czech government outlines a five-step plan for re-opening shops, restaurants and other businesses. Each subsequent step will be triggered as planned only if the previous step has not resulted in a total of 400 new COVID-19 patients per day.[96]


Infographic for the official re-opening plan (in Czech) as released by the Czech government
20 April: Farmers markets, tradesmen with shops, car shops and showrooms, outdoor athletic areas for professionals, without spectators, Weddings of up to 10 people following hygiene rules
27 April: Shops under 200 square metres in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5,000 square metres and those specified to open at a later date.
11 May: Shops under 1,000 square metres in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5,000 square metres and those specified to open at a later date, Driving schools, Gyms and fitness centers (but not changing rooms or showers)
25 May: Outdoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops with outdoor sales and garden seating areas, barbershops, hairdressers, nail salons, tanning salons, cosmetic salons, massage parlors, museums, galleries, and art halls, zoos (outdoor areas only)
8 June: All shops in shopping centers, shops over 1,000 square metres in size outside of shopping centers, indoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops, hotels and other accommodation providers (and their restaurants and cafes), taxi services, tattoo and piercing studios, theatres, castles, chateaux and other cultural activities according to the current regulations, mass events for a specified number of people, cultural, business, and sports events for less than 50 people, weddings following specific hygienic protocol, indoor areas of zoos
The aforementioned timeline was not kept as government significantly accelerated lifting of restrictions in the following weeks, with most being lifted by 11 May.

Week 17 (20–26 April)
22 April – Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced that the Government will not request the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament to extend the State of Emergency beyond 30 April. Meanwhile, Minister of Interior announced that he will seek further discussion of the topic, claiming that State of Emergency is crucial for Government's ability to fast procure and distribute personal protection equipment outside of standard lawful procurement process.[97]

The court determined that the fact that measures were not adopted by the Government under the Crisis Act powers, but by Ministry of Health under the Protection of Public Health Act, leads to violation of constitutional guarantees of separation of powers. When adopting measures under the Crisis Act, the Government is continually under the supervision of the Chamber of Deputies of Parliament. Under Art 5(4) of the Constitutional Act on the Security of the Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies can revoke the State of Emergency at any moment. Thus taking away Government's power to adopt crisis measures under the Crisis Act, including those that violate basic rights. Adoption of the measures by Ministry of Health under the Act on Protection of Public Health frustrated this control by the Chamber of Deputies. In effect, the respondent impermissibly restricted constitutional powers of the Chamber of Deputies.

— Judgement of the Municipal Court in Prague No. 14 A 41/2020, section 152, from 23 April 2020[98]
23 April – The Municipal Court in Prague invalidated some of the restrictions adopted to battle the COVID-19 spread. In particular, the court invalidated Ministry of Health Protection Measures that introduced curfew, banned hospital visits and banned selected retail sale and services. The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March, respectively; however, then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards. The court invalidated these measures from 27 April onwards, giving the Government three days to remedy the situation. The Ministry of Health may lodge an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. On the day of court's decision, there were suits against 17 other measures still pending.[99]

While Ministry of Health Protection Measures may be adopted indefinitely, Government Measures under Crisis Act may be adopted only for period of State of Emergency.[100] Government may declare State of Emergency for period of 30 days, any prolongation requires assent of the Chamber of Deputies.[101]

24 April – In line with the decision of the Municipal Court of Prague, the Government announced that it would seek Chamber of Deputies' consent to extend the State of Emergency until 25 May. At the same time the Government announced a faster roadmap for the lifting of restrictions.[102]

Week 18 (27 April – 3 May)
28 April – The Government sought an extension of the State of Emergency until 25 May 2020. The Chamber of Deputies of Parliament granted an extension until 17 May 2020.[103]

Week 19 (4–10 May)
6 May – The Ministry of Health presented the outcome of the COVID-19 prevalence study conducted over the previous weeks. Out of 26,549 people (volunteers and vulnerable groups with chronic diseases) tested for the presence of anti-bodies, the countrywide testing identified only 107 people with antibodies who were previously undetected. This showed a high success rate of contact tracing and quarantine measures and a very low rate of virus presence in the general population.[104]

Week 20 (11–17 May)
Restaurants closure during pandemic
COVID19 – people waiting in front of restaurant in Prague for takeaway.
Between 14 March and 10 May 2020 restaurants could serve patrons only by direct delivery or through a takeaway window (doors).
COVID19 – people enjoying outside premises of restaurant.
Between 11 and 24 May 2020 restaurants could also serve patrons at their outdoors premises.
State of Emergency ended on 17 May. Extraordinary measures either ended or were extended beyond the State of Emergency with lesser restrictions. According to Ministry of Health, the main aim going forward was to achieve three main objectives:[105]

Prevent hospital overcapacity in order to be able to provide necessary care to all patients with COVID-19, including non-hospitalised. The main aim is to preserve Czech COVID-19 mortality at 2–3% as before and to prevent its rise to worldwide average of 7% or French mortality of 18%.
Prevent "explosive spread" of COVID-19 that would (a) include spread of more aggressive types of COVID-19 or (b) higher concentration of COVID-19 in body, as those lead to more dangerous development of illness.
Further lower mortality as better knowledge about COVID-19 and use of promising experimental drugs like remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine becomes available.
A court ordered pre-trial detention of a first person charged with spreading of COVID-19. A 32-year-old woman was arrested for movement at a public space without a face mask, although she had been personally ordered to remain in quarantine. Despite quarantine order, the woman used a taxi and visited a shopping mall. The woman was jailed at a hospital ward of Brno prison. If convicted, she may be sentenced to up to 8 years' imprisonment.[106]

Week 21 (18–25 May)
A new major COVID-19 hotspot emerged in the city of Karviná. Over 150 workers became infected at a black coal mine where miners work in tight shafts as deep as 1,000 metres[107] underground. Authorities expected the number to significantly rise further as the workers' family members were likely to become positive later. Among those infected were also many foreign workers from Poland, where coal mines became hotspots in previous weeks. Health authority planned to conduct testing of all 2,400 workers within three days. Czech Army deployed six medical teams to assist local authority in collection of samples and contact tracing. As of 22 May, up to 40% of infected miners had no symptoms with many others reporting tiredness as the only symptom. Meanwhile, a school was temporarily closed down in nearby city of Havířov after a child of one of the miners tested positive. Apart from the coal mining hotspot, authorities deemed situation in the rest of the country as stable, except for Prague where they identified several small clusters with community spread.[108][109][110]

*The reproduction number (R ratio) is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. If the reproduction number is higher than one (1,0), then the number of cases increases exponentially if the number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.[140][circular reference]

Epidemic curve

Inhibiting new infections to reduce the number of cases at any given time—known as flattening the curve—allows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients.[143]
Flattening the curve
The main priority of affected nations currently is to move to a slower doubling time of new cases, to ensure less crowded hospitals and therefore a lower case-fatality rate.[144][145]

Governments of different countries take different approaches to flatten the epidemic curve. Beside travel bans and isolation of complete communities, citizens are also often requested to stay at home and keep social distance.[144]

Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately to be effective. Also, the national community's commitment to supporting/tolerating the restrictions and following the advice of health authorities plays an important role in the success of flattening the epidemic curve and limiting the spread of the virus.[146][147]

For example, in South Korea mass testing efforts were successful. The South Korean national testing capacity reached 15,000 tests per day. Compared to population size, the Czech Republic reached the same rate of testing on 23 March 2020. The Ministry of Interior in South Korea also rolled out a smartphone app that can track the quarantined and collect data on symptoms, so scientists are able to see more epidemiological data.[148]

Curve comparison

This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2020)
Comparing cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in selected countries, including the Czech Republic, shows the different curves of the epidemic in different countries.[149][150] The chart shows the number of known cases and the pace at which the number increases on a logarithmic scale. The actual number of people infected may be and likely is, significantly higher, as only cases where the virus was confirmed by laboratory testing are shown. Many cases may only have an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic course of the disease and never seek treatment. In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.[151]

Interpersonal solidarity
Demonstration of making face masks without sewing
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic has created a wave of solidarity in a variety of areas, including:

Due to the lack of protective face masks, volunteers sewed masks for other people and also shared instruction videos online.[291]
Programmes were launched to help the most vulnerable groups and seniors, on a non-commercial basis, by buying food and medicines.[292]
On Monday, 23 March, Czech National Television launched a temporary new television channel ČT3, which is to bring practical advice, news and a selection of ČT's classic programmes from the archive for older people.[293]
Throughout the nation, people made so-called 'mask-trees' to share face coverings.[294]
The Vietnamese community in the Ústí nad Labem region raised CZK 140,000 for a donation of a ventilator to a hospital in Ústí nad Labem[295]
Due to the closure of Czech schools, Czech National Television launched an educational programme for home education. The "UčíTelka" programme is focusing on teaching first-grade pupils. The programmes "Odpoledka" on teaching second-grade pupils and programme "Škola doma" for ninth-grade pupils preparing them for entrance exams to secondary schools.[296]
Czech manufacturer of 3D printers Prusa Research contributed to the "free use project" of shared bicycles company Rekola to enable access to transport with a lower risk of virus transmission than public transport.[297] Prusa Research also designed, produced and distributed protective face shields for medical professionals.[298]
The Žufánek family distillery from Boršice will produce and distribute for free disinfectant gels without the necessary permit from the health and agriculture department.[299]

Season 5
The sixth season of Philippine amateur singing competition Tawag ng Tanghalan, titled Tawag ng Tanghalan: Ika-anim na Taon, was an amateur singing competition aired as a segment of the noontime variety television show It's Showtime.[1] The segment premiered from November 22, 2021 to May 6, 2023.

From January 6 to 15, 2022, daily live production of It's Showtime was halted due to the surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. The season resumed on January 17, 2022.[2]

From July 15, 2022 to April 29, 2023, the airtime of this segment was temporarily shortened due to 45 minutes of It's Showtime's airtime being given to Tropang LOL.[3][4][5]

Additionally, this season of Tawag ng Tanghalan is considered as the longest of all its seasons and probably the longest competition in the world as it lasted for a year and six months.

Changes
The mechanics for the daily rounds for this season were modified. In the first round, dubbed as "Battle of Versions," daily contenders perform the same song with their renditions. The winners of the first round advance to the second round, dubbed as the "Face-off," where contestants perform a song of their choice to snatch the golden microphone from the defending champion. The champion who defends their title five times advances to the quarterfinals, whereas reaching the eighth time automatically grants them a place in the semifinals.[6]

Hosts and judges
Vhong Navarro, Vice Ganda, Amy Perez, and Kim Chiu reprised their roles as hosts, with Karylle, Ion Perez, Ogie Alcasid, and Jackie Gonzaga as the rotating fifth co-host. Anne Curtis and Jhong Hilario both returned to their hosting duties in May and June after their respective hiatuses.

Ryan Bang reprised his role as gong master with substitutes Jameson Blake and Maymay Entrata, and Jugs Jugueta, and Teddy Corpuz appeared in past roles occasionally.

Jugueta, Corpuz and Perez returned as backstage hosts.

Louie Ocampo, Ogie Alcasid, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Erik Santos, Klarisse de Guzman, Nyoy Volante, Jed Madela, Karylle, Yeng Constantino, Kyla, Angeline Quinto, and Jolina Magdangal returned as judges for the sixth season. Marco Sison, Darren Espanto, and Jona Viray joined the judging panel on November 1, 2022, February 21, 2023 and April 17, 2023 respectively.

Starting from May 1, 2023, the amount of judges returned to 5 judges for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines implemented restrictions that caused the amount of judges to be reduced to 3 judges.

Randy Santiago, Rey Valera, and K Brosas did not return due to their commitments to Sing Galing. Past judges Karla Estrada and Mitoy Yonting also did not return. However, Gary Valenciano, reprised his role for the grand finale.

Prizes
The defending champion receives ₱10,000 while the losing contenders receive ₱5,000.

Season 5
The sixth season of Philippine amateur singing competition Tawag ng Tanghalan, titled Tawag ng Tanghalan: Ika-anim na Taon, was an amateur singing competition aired as a segment of the noontime variety television show It's Showtime.[1] The segment premiered from November 22, 2021 to May 6, 2023.

From January 6 to 15, 2022, daily live production of It's Showtime was halted due to the surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. The season resumed on January 17, 2022.[2]

From July 15, 2022 to April 29, 2023, the airtime of this segment was temporarily shortened due to 45 minutes of It's Showtime's airtime being given to Tropang LOL.[3][4][5]

Additionally, this season of Tawag ng Tanghalan is considered as the longest of all its seasons and probably the longest competition in the world as it lasted for a year and six months.

Changes
The mechanics for the daily rounds for this season were modified. In the first round, dubbed as "Battle of Versions," daily contenders perform the same song with their renditions. The winners of the first round advance to the second round, dubbed as the "Face-off," where contestants perform a song of their choice to snatch the golden microphone from the defending champion. The champion who defends their title five times advances to the quarterfinals, whereas reaching the eighth time automatically grants them a place in the semifinals.[6]

Hosts and judges
Vhong Navarro, Vice Ganda, Amy Perez, and Kim Chiu reprised their roles as hosts, with Karylle, Ion Perez, Ogie Alcasid, and Jackie Gonzaga as the rotating fifth co-host. Anne Curtis and Jhong Hilario both returned to their hosting duties in May and June after their respective hiatuses.

Ryan Bang reprised his role as gong master with substitutes Jameson Blake and Maymay Entrata, and Jugs Jugueta, and Teddy Corpuz appeared in past roles occasionally.

Jugueta, Corpuz and Perez returned as backstage hosts.

Louie Ocampo, Ogie Alcasid, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Erik Santos, Klarisse de Guzman, Nyoy Volante, Jed Madela, Karylle, Yeng Constantino, Kyla, Angeline Quinto, and Jolina Magdangal returned as judges for the sixth season. Marco Sison, Darren Espanto, and Jona Viray joined the judging panel on November 1, 2022, February 21, 2023 and April 17, 2023 respectively.

Starting from May 1, 2023, the amount of judges returned to 5 judges for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines implemented restrictions that caused the amount of judges to be reduced to 3 judges.

Randy Santiago, Rey Valera, and K Brosas did not return due to their commitments to Sing Galing. Past judges Karla Estrada and Mitoy Yonting also did not return. However, Gary Valenciano, reprised his role for the grand finale.

Prizes
The defending champion receives ₱10,000 while the losing contenders receive ₱5,000.

Menelik I, founder of the Solomonic dynasty according to Ethiopian and Eritrean tradition.
This is a list of legendary monarchs of Ethiopia, based on a king list provided by Ethiopian prince regent Tafari Makonnen (later known as Emperor Haile Selassie), with reference to multiple Ethiopian traditions and legends. Other Ethiopian king lists are discussed in the Other King Lists section.

Over Ethiopia's long history, multiple kingdoms and states have ruled, with one of the earliest known being Dʿmt from the 10th century B.C., followed by Axum in the 1st century A.D., which lasted until the 10th century. The last royal dynasty of Ethiopia was the Solomonic dynasty, who ruled until 1975 when the monarchy was overthrown by the Derg. Numerous king lists are in existence which chronicle the lineage of monarchs before the Solomonic dynasty, but often with noticeable disagreements between them.

An official chronicle of the monarchs of Ethiopia from the royal family was published in Charles Fernand Rey's book In the Country of the Blue Nile in 1927, and is the longest Ethiopian king list published in the Western world, claiming that over 300 monarchs ruled from 4530 B.C. to 1779 A.D. However, earlier portions of the king list are Pseudohistorical, and this has been noted by archaeologists and historians such as E. A. Wallis Budge and Manfred Kropp. The king list, written in 1922, brings together a wide range of names from older king lists but also additionally includes figures from Biblical, Coptic, Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, Ancient Greek and Arab sources. These figures are later additions of the 20th century and do not appear on earlier Ethiopian king lists. The inclusion of these additional names largely stems from the usage of the word Aethiopia in ancient times to refer to multiple different regions, most prominently Nubia and the Kingdom of Kush, located in modern-day Sudan rather than modern-day Ethiopia or Eritrea.

Many of the claimed ancient monarchs of Ethiopia, such as Ethiopis, Angabo, Makeda, Menelik I and Abreha and Atsbeha are not archeologically attested as of yet, and information on them largely comes from oral traditions within Ethiopia or from texts written centuries after they are claimed to have lived.

Tradition

Depiction of the Queen of Sheba, named Makeda in Ethiopian tradition, from the medieval manuscript "Bellafortis" by Conrad Kyeser (c. 1405).
Ethiopian traditions record a range of different monarchs from earlier times whose existence has not been verified by modern-day archeology. Their stories and legends may have elements of truth but it is unclear to what extent this is the case. Numerous king lists have been recorded either on manuscripts or via oral tradition. However, surviving information on the kings prior to the reign of emperor Yekuno Amlak (1270–1285) is often scattered, incomplete or contradictory.[1][2] The king lists that do refer to pre-1270 Ethiopia rarely match completely with one another.[3] This variation is likely because the lists were compiled over a long time period across several different monasteries.[4]

Notable legendary Ethiopian monarchs include:

Arwe – Mythical serpent king who ruled for 400 years before being killed by Angabo, sometimes known as the father of the Queen of Sheba.
Ethiopis – A king who was said to have inspired the name of the country of Ethiopia.
Makeda – The biblical queen of Sheba who, according to Ethiopian tradition, is believed to be the mother of Menelik I.
Menelik I – Son of the queen of Sheba and king Solomon of Israel and founder of the Solomonic dynasty in the 10th century BC. Much information on this king comes from the 14th century text Kebra Nagast, however he remains historically unverified. In reality, the Solomonic dynasty began in 1270 AD with the reign of Yekuno Amlak.
Abreha and Atsbeha – Two brothers who supposedly brought Christianity to Ethiopia, however their existence is doubted by some historians. Some scholars believe that the story of Abreha and Atsbeha may in fact be based on the Axumite kings Ezana and Saizana.[5]
Gudit – Legendary queen who supposedly laid waste to the Kingdom of Axum. Her deeds are recorded in oral tradition, but the various stories about her occasionally have differing or conflicting details.
This article will be mostly focusing on a 1922 king list written by the then Prince Regent of Ethiopia Tafari Makannon (the future emperor Haile Selassie) and published in 1927.[6] It is the only known king list that attempts to provide a timeline of Ethiopian monarchs from the 46th century B.C. up to modern times without any gaps.[7] There are however different versions that exist of this king list, and it is not clear when the first version was written. Ethiopian foreign minister Heruy Wolde Selassie is a contender for the author of the original king list.[8] His book Wazema contains a version of the list that begins in 2545 B.C. instead of 4530 B.C. like on Tafari's list.[9] Aleka Taye Gabra Mariam also wrote a variation of this king list which has some slight differences in names and reign dates.[10] These variations will be mentioned and discussed in this article. The 1922 king list will be referred to as "Tafari's list" in this article in order to differentiate it from other versions. However, Tafari himself did not claim authorship and instead stated that he had made a copy of an already existing list.[11]

Defining "Ethiopia"
It is important to note that this king list contains a great deal of conflation between the history of modern-day Ethiopia and Aethiopia, a term used in ancient times and in some Biblical translations to refer to a generalised region south of Egypt, most commonly in reference to the Kingdom of Kush in modern-day Sudan. As a result, many parts of this article will deal with the history of ancient Sudan and how this became interwoven into the history of the Kingdom of Axum, Abyssinia (which includes modern-day Eritrea) and the modern-day state of Ethiopia. The territory of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea was known as "Abyssinia" to Europeans until the mid-20th century, and as such this term will be used occasionally in this article to differentiate from 'ancient' Aethiopia (i.e. Nubia).

Tafari Makonnen's King List
Background

Tafari Makonnen in 1923.
Charles Fernand Rey's 1927 book In the Country of the Blue Nile included a 13-page appendix with a list of Ethiopian kings written by the Prince Regent Tafari Makonnen, who later became the emperor of Ethiopia in 1930.[6] Tafari's list stretches back to 4530 B.C. and ends in 1779 A.D., with dates following the Ethiopian Calendar.[12] Tafari's cover letter was written in the town of Addis Ababa on the 11th day of Sane, 1914 (Ethiopian Calendar), which was 19 June 1922 on the Gregorian Calendar according to Rey.[11] Rey himself was awarded Commander of the Order of the Star of Ethiopia by Tafari.[13]

The goal of Tafari's list was to showcase the immense longevity of the Ethiopian monarchy. The list does this by providing precise dates over 6,300 years and drawing upon various historical traditions from both within Ethiopia and outside of Ethiopia (see "Historicity" section below).

The king list includes 312 monarchs divided into eight dynasties:

Tribe of Aram (4530–3244 B.C.) (21 monarchs)
Tribe of Kam (2713–1985 B.C.) (24 monarchs)
Agdazyan dynasty (1985–982 B.C.) (52 monarchs)
Dynasty of Menelik I (982 B.C.–493 A.D.) (132 monarchs)
Dynasty of Kaleb (493–920) (27 monarchs)
Zagwe dynasty (920–1253) (11 monarchs)
Solomonic dynasty (1253–1555) (26 monarchs) and its Gondarian branch (1555–1779) (18 monarchs)
In addition to the above, there is an "Israelitish" dynasty with 8 unnumbered kings from the time of Zagwe rule which did not ascend to the throne of Ethiopia.

The first three dynasties are mostly legendary and take various elements from the Bible, as well as Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, Greek, Coptic and Arab sources. Many of the monarchs of the Menelik and Kaleb dynasties appear on earlier Ethiopian king lists, but these lists often contradict one another and many of the kings themselves have not been archeologically verified, though some of the later kings on Tafari's list are confirmed by Aksumite coinage. Many of the historically verified rulers of the Agdazyan and Menelik dynasties did not rule over Ethiopia but rather over Egypt and/or Nubia. It is only from the dynasty of Kaleb onwards that the monarchs are certainly Ethiopian or Aksumite in origin. The Zagwe and Solomonic dynasties are both historically verified, though only the Solomonic line has a secure dating of 1270 to 1975, which at times contradicts the reign dates found Tafari's list.

The following table outlines the origins of the dynasties of the 1922 king list:

#	Dynasty	Cultural Sources
1	Ori	Egyptian (Coptic, Islamic and Pharaonic), Biblical
2	Kam	Biblical, Greek, Egyptian (Pharaonic)
3	Agdazyan	Biblical, Greek, Egyptian (Pharaonic), Nubian, Native Ethiopian/Axumite
4	Menelik (B.C. era)	Native Ethiopian/Axumite, Nubian, Egyptian (Pharaonic), Biblical
5	Menelik (A.D. pre-Christian era)	Native Ethiopian/Axumite, Nubian, Biblical
6	Menelik (Christian era)	Native Ethiopian/Axumite
7	Kaleb	Native Ethiopian/Axumite
8	Zagwe	Native Ethiopian
9	Solomonic	Native Ethiopian
10	Gondar	Native Ethiopian
Because of the length of the Menelik dynasty, Tafari's king list breaks up the line of monarchs into three sub-sections, concerning the time periods 982 BC–9 AD (the monarchs who reigned before the birth of Jesus Christ), 9–306 AD (Pre-Christian monarchs who reigned after the birth of Christ) and 306–493 AD (Monarchs of this line who were Christian themselves). Tafari's list names the kings from Kaleb to Dil Na'od as a separate dynasty, however other Ethiopian king lists do not make the same distinction and the Solomonic dynasty additionally claimed descent from Menelik I through Dil Na'od.

Each monarch has their respective reign dates and number of years listed. Two columns of reign dates were used in the list. One column uses dates according to the Ethiopian calendar from 4530 B.C. to 1779 A.D., while the other column lists the "Year of the World", placing the creation of the world in 5500 B.C. Other Ethiopian texts and documents have also placed a similar date for the creation of the world, such as a manuscript in which the year 7260 A.M. was equivalent to the Gregorian date 1768, placing the creation of the world at 5492 B.C.[14] Another manuscript in dated to the year 7276 A.M. and is equivalent to 1784 A.D., which would place the beginning of the world in 5492 B.C. as well.[15] Considering that the Ethiopian calendar is roughly 7 or 8 years behind the Gregorian calendar, this would match very closely with the date given on Tafari's list of 5500 B.C. (Ethiopian calendar). E. A. Wallis Budge noted that the Abyssinians/Ethiopians believed that the world was created "at the autumnal equinox 5500 years before the birth of Christ" and had previously used this as their main dating system.[16] The dating of 5500 B.C. as the creation of the world on this list is likely influenced by calculations from the Alexandrian and Byzantine eras which placed the world's creation in 5493 B.C. and 5509 B.C. respectively.[17]

The use of Biblical figures in royal lineage has also been found in other fictitious histories, such as the Swedish Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus, written in the 16th century.

Response to the King List

E. A. Wallis Budge in 1920.
Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge was dismissive of the claims of great antiquity made by the Abyssinians, whom he described as having a "passionate desire to be considered a very ancient nation", which had been aided by the "vivid imagination of their scribes" who borrowed traditions from the Semites (such as Yamanites, Himyarites and Hebrews) and modified them to "suit [their] aspirations".[18] He noted the lack of pre-Christian king lists and believed that there was no 'kingdom' of Abyssinia/Ethiopia until the time of king Zoskales.[18] Budge additionally stated that all extant manuscripts date to the 17th–19th centuries and believed that any king lists found in them originated from Arab and Coptic writers.[1] Budge felt that Tafari's king list "proves" that "almost all kings of Abyssinia were of Asiatic origin" and descended from "Southern or Northern Semites" before the reign of Yekuno Amlak.[19] However, native Ethiopian rule before Yekuno Amlak is evidenced by the kingdoms of D'mt and Aksum, as well as by the rule of the Zagwe dynasty.

Budge divided Abyssinian/Ethiopian history into the following sections:[20]

5500–1000 B.C. (Mythical)
1000–Nativity of Jesus (Traditional)
Nativity–1268 A.D. (Semi-historical)
1268–present (Historical)
With the above groupings, it is clear that Budge does not consider any of the kings of Tafari's list who reigned from 4530 to 1013 B.C. (i.e. before the reign of Makeda) to be historically verifiable.

The Geographical Journal reviewed In the Country of the Blue Nile in 1928, and noted the king list, which contained "many more names [...] than in previously published lists" and was "evidently a careful compilation" which helps to "clear up the tangled skein of Ethiopian history".[21] However, the reviewer did also notice that it "[contained] discrepancies" which Rey "makes no attempt to clear up".[21] The reviewer points to how king Dil Na'od is said to have reigned for 10 years from 910 to 920 A.D., yet travel writer James Bruce stated that the deposition of this dynasty occurred in 960 A.D., 40 years later.[21] The reviewer does admit, however, that Egyptologist Henry Salt's dating of this event to 925 A.D. may have had "more reason" to it compared to Bruce's dating, considering that Salt's dating is seemingly backed up by Tafari's king list.[21]

Contemporary historian Manfred Kropp described the king list as an artfully woven document developed as a rational and scientific attempt by an educated Ethiopian from the early 20th century to reconcile historical knowledge of Ethiopia.[22] Kropp noted that king list has often been viewed by historians as little more than an example of a vague notion of historical tradition in north-east Africa.[22] However he did also note that the working methods and sources used by the author of the king list remain unclear.[22] Kropp further stated that despite some rulers' names having astonishing similarities to those of Egyptian and Meroitic rulers, there has been little attempt to critically examine the king list in relation to other Ethiopian sources.[23]

Kropp further noted that Tafari's king list was the first Ethiopian king that attempted to provide the names of kings from the 970th year of the world's creation onwards without any chronological gaps.[7] In particular, it was the first Ethiopian king list to consistently fill in all dates from the time of Solomon to the Zagwe dynasty.[7] Kropp felt that the king list was a result of incorporating non-native traditions of Ethiopia into the native Ethiopian history.[7]

Historicity and Sources

Coin of king Endubis.
The king list includes a mixture of legendary and historically verifiable rulers. The earliest monarchs are most likely legendary. Many kings from the reigns of Makeda and Menelik I onwards appear to be verified through their appearances on other existing king lists from Ethiopia itself. However, these king lists are not always supported by archaeological evidence. Aksumite kings from approximately the third century onwards minted coins, a practice that may have begun either with the reign of Endubis or a short time before and continued until the 7th century. These coins help to prove the historicity of some kings on Tafari's list, but there are also many kings named on these coins who do not appear on Tafari's list. Likewise, there are numerous kings on Tafari's list who allegedly reigned during the Aksumite period that are otherwise unattested in the archaeological record beyond the king lists that were written centuries after the fall of the kingdom of Aksum (c. 960). While there are undoubtedly traces of historical fact on Tafari's king list, it is only from the Zagwe dynasty onwards that the names and order of the kings match the opinion of historians and archeologists who study Ethiopia. Although even the Zagwe dynasty has differing traditions on the order of the kings (see Alternate Zagwe dynasty lists).

Heruy Wolde Selassie and Wazema

German historian Manfred Kropp believed the author of the king list was Ethiopian foreign minister Heruy Wolde Selassie (1878–1938).[8] Selassie was later foreign minister to Haile Selassie and was a philosopher and historian, as well as being able to master several European languages.[8] He had previously served as secretary to emperor Menelik II.[8] Kropp noted that Selassie's historical sources include the Bible, Christian Arab writers Jirjis al-Makin Ibn al-'Amid and Ibn al-Rāhib, and Christian traveller and writer Sextus Julius Africanus.[24] Kropp argued that Selassie was one of a number of Ethiopian writers who sought to synchronize Ethiopian history with the wider Christian-Oriental histories.[24] This was aided by the translation of Arabic texts in the 17th century.[24] Kropp also felt that the developing field of Egyptology influenced Selassie's writings, particularly from Eduard Meyer, Gaston Maspero and Alexandre Moret, whose works were published in French in Addis Ababa in the early 20th century.[24] Manfred Kropp additionally noted the existence of multiple versions of the king list, which suggest that Selassie grew increasingly critical of the sources he used for the first version of the list in 1922.[24] Kropp believed that Selassie was also assisted by French missionaries and the works they held in their libraries.[22]

Selassie wrote a book called Wazema which contained a variation of the king list.[9] Kropp stated that there were three different versions of the king list published in the works of Heruy Wolde Selassie.[9] Selassie's king list omits the first dynasty of Tafari's list – the so-called "Tribe of Ori or Aram" – and also the first three rulers of the second dynasty, instead beginning in 2545 B.C. with king Sebtah.[9] Selassie himself stated that he used European literature amongst his sources, including James Bruce's Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile.[9]

Manfred Kropp noted one important source for the information in Wazema. Selassie himself told the reader that if they wish to find out about more about Joktan, the supposed founder of the Ag'azyan dynasty, they could consult page 237 of a book by "Moraya".[25] At first Kropp thought this was referring to Alexandre Moret,[25] but it was later made clear that Selassie's king list had been inspired by a book called Histoire de l'Éthiopie (Nubie et Abyssinie) by Louis J. Morié, published in 1904.[26]

Louis J. Morié's Histoire de l'Éthiopie
Louis J. Morié was a French historian who wrote a history of Ethiopia in the early 20th century. The two-volume work, titled Histoire de l'Éthiopie (Nubie et Abyssinie), was published in 1904 and was the first part of a series on the history of Africa, with the first volume focusing on ancient Nubia (also called "Ancient Ethiopia" by Morié) and the second volume focusing on Abyssinia ("Modern Ethiopia").[27][28] Historian Manfred Kropp identified the first volume as a key source in the creation of the Ethiopian king list that was copied by Tafari Makannon in 1922 and published in Charles F. Rey's book In the Country of the Blue Nile in 1927.[26] Kropp provided examples from Morie's text, specifically page 237 which provides information on Piori I (no. 46 on the king list) and pages 304–305 which provide information on the High Priests of Amun that appear on the Ethiopian king list, including the additional "Pinedjem" whose existence was an error of early Egyptology.[26] Kropp described the discovery of the king list's source as exciting but mixed with some "bitterness" as Morié's book is more imaginative than scientific in its approach to Ethiopian history.[26] Kropp blamed Selassie's European friends and contemporaries for the influence of Morié's book on Selassie's writing of Ethiopian history.[26] Peter Truhart's Regents of Nations includes a list of Ethiopian kings resembling the 1922 list with additional information resembling that found in Morié's book, suggesting that Truhart was aware of this text being the source of a large part of the king list.[29] E. A. Wallis Budge mentions Morié's book in his own similarly titled two-volume work A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia,[30] but surprisingly makes no mention of the clear similarity between Morié's narrative and the 1922 Ethiopian king list.

Louis J. Morié believed that it was during the reign of an Egyptian pharaoh, either Pepi I or Pepi II, that a colony of Sabaeans came to Aethiopia.[31] This may have been the inspiration behind the narrative of the Ag'azyan dynasty on the 1922 king list, in which a Sabaean dynasty arrived in Ethiopia and became its rulers. Morié's book is also possibly the inspiration behind the inclusion of the "Tribe of Ori or Aram" on the 1922 king list, which was very similar to the legendary "Soleyman" dynasty from Coptic and Arabic folklore of Egypt.[32] While Selassie's original king list did not include this dynasty, Morié's book may have nonetheless been retained and used by another Ethiopian writer who expanded the king list.

Morié's book displays his desire to hold on to religion and Biblical narratives in a world that was increasingly looking towards science. He showed concern with the possibility of abandoning religion, which would result in the "civilized" peoples of the world to descend down the moral scale.[33] Morié felt that it was possible for science and religion to be in agreement.[34] He described Atheism as one of the greatest scourges of nations and a cause of moral and political decadence.[35] Because of his anxieties of the decline of religion, Morié sought to base his historical narrative around the Biblical timeline. He described the Book of Genesis as the best source to consult on the most remote parts of human history.[36]

Morié believed that the "Ethiopian state of Meroe" was the oldest empire of the post-Flood world, having been founded by Cush of the Bible, and went on to birth the kingdoms of Egypt, Uruk, Babylon, Assyria and Abyssinia.[37] Morié followed the Biblical tradition by crediting Nimrod, a son of Cush, with founding Uruk and Babylon, and crediting Mizraim, a son of Ham, with founding Egypt.[34] He additionally identified Mizraim with the Egyptian god Osiris, Ham with Amun and Cush with Khonsu.[38]

Louis J. Morié defined the history of "Ethiopia" as divided into two parts; Ancient Nubia and Christian Abyssinia,[39] and defined "Ethiopians" as the Nubian and Abyssinian peoples.[40] E.A. Wallis Budge similarity defined "Ethiopia" as including both Nubia and Abyssinia in his own two-volume work A History of Ethiopia, published in 1928. Morié acknowledged the potential confusion this could cause and thus occasionally used "Abyssinia" to specify which of these two regions he was writing about, with a priority of using "Ethiopia" for ancient Nubia.[41]

Comparison between Morié's and Tafari's king lists
The following collapsible table compares the list of kings found in Louis J. Morié's Histoire de l'Éthiopie (Volume 1) with the 1922 Ethiopian king list. After the so-called "Blemmyes dynasty", Morié continued naming kings of Nubia, grouped together as the "Nobate dynasty" (548–c. 1145), the "kings of Dongola" (c. 1145–1820) and the "kings of Sennar".[159] However, Tafari's king list ignores Nubian and Sudanese kings after the fall of the Kingdom of Kush.

Louis J. Morié	Tafari Makannon
Aleka Taye's History of the People of Ethiopia
Aleka Taye Gabra Mariam (1861–1924) was a Protestant Ethiopian scholar, translator and teacher whose written works include books on grammar, religion and Ethiopian history.[197] Taye was sent to Germany in 1905 by Emperor Menelik II to teach Ge'ez and Amharic at the School of Oriental Studies in Berlin, and to recover some rare Ethiopian books that had been taken to Germany.[198] Taye ultimately brought back 130 books for the Emperor.[199]

Taye was ordered by Menelik II to write a complete history of Ethiopia using Ethiopian, European and Arab sources.[200] Taye's work was not published in his lifetime. His book History of the People of Ethiopia was published in Asmara in 1928 and is believed by historiographers to be part of a larger unpublished manuscript that also dealt with the history of the world and the history of the Ethiopian kings.[200] However, the book on the Ethiopian kings was only half-printed due to the Italian Occupation of Ethiopia in 1935 and was never completed.[200] There is also some controversy over whether Taye was truly the author of this book.[200]

As Taye died in 1924, his text would have pre-dated the publication of Charles Fernand Rey's book In the Country of the Blue Nile in 1927 but it is unclear if it pre-dated the writing of Tafari's king list in 1922. It is possible that Taye's text could have influenced Tafari's list, especially as it was written for the benefit of the Ethiopian monarchy in the first place. According to Dr. Ghelawdewos Araia, Taye's History of the People of Ethiopia was actually published in 1914, with Heruy Wolde Selassie's book Wazema being published later, in 1921.[10] This suggests that Taye may be a more likely source for Tafari's king list and he may have influenced Selassie's history of Ethiopia.

Taye's History of the People of Ethiopia contains a king list that matches closely with the one written by Tafari.[10] The names, order, reign lengths and dates of monarchs from the Agdazyan dynasty to the Solomonic dynasty mostly match with what is written on Tafari's list, though with some occasional differences.[10]

Tafari ultimately did not reveal the sources of information for his king list in his brief cover letter, but there are clear references to Ethiopian tradition and many historically verified kings appearing in later portions of the list. Tafari stated that he had "taken a copy" of the list and sent it to Rey, writing in his cover letter that he would be happy to send more information on the history of Ethiopia if asked again.[11] This would suggest that the king list already existed in some form and that Tafari had simply copied down the information included, possibly from the work of Heruy Wolde Selassie or Aleka Taye mentioned above. In any case, the list was clearly intended to be a royal chronicle of the Ethiopian monarchy presented for an English-speaking and reading audience. E. A. Wallis Budge believed that Tafari's king list was likely compiled by the "most competent of scholars and scribes in Adis Ababa", though likely also contained the "considered opinions of Government officials in Abyssinia".[201]

Manfred Kropp noted that numerous king lists exist that date back to the 13th century and these are reliable documents.[23] However, for the period before this there are only legendary memories of the Axumite rulers.[2] King lists were created to provide a connection between the Solomonic dynasty and the legendary Axumite kings while skipping the Zagwe dynasty.[202] Such lists were written for the purpose of proving the legitimacy of the ruling Solomonic emperors and had information drawn from chronicles held in monasteries.[202] Kropp believed that Ethiopian king lists were intended to fill in the gaps between major events, such as the meeting of Makeda and Solomon, the arrival of Frumentius and the beginning of the Zagwe dynasty.[4] The great variation in names and order between king lists was likely because this process took place across several different monasteries and were also passed on orally.[4]

E. A. Wallis Budge felt that any written information on the period of Ethiopian history before the 13th century was "incomplete" and "untrustworthy".[1] However, he felt that this was because any king lists or chronological works held in Axum were likely burned or destroyed before Yekuno Amlak ascended the throne in 1270.[1] Budge noted that numerous king lists were known to exist in which the number and order of kings were rarely the same.[3] He felt that it was clear that the chronographers of Abyssinia from the 13th and 14th centuries "did not know how many kings had reigned over [their country] from the time of Makeda [...] or the exact order of succession".[3] Budge theorized that while the kings lists showed evidence that they were based on legend and tradition, some parts of the list suggested that the scribes did indeed "[have] access to chronological and historical documents of some kind", including Coptic and Arabic texts which were possibly brought over by monks fleeing Egypt and Nubia during the time of the Arab conquests.[3] Some lists began with Adam or David.[3]

European travellers James Bruce, Henry Salt and Carlo Conti Rossini all published different king lists in Europe between the late 18th and early 20th centuries.[109] The lists were written based on information gathered from local Ethiopian scribes.[203] These king lists contain a list of names from Menelik I to Dil Na'od, but both the names and order of kings only occasionally overlap between the different lists, and there are numerous kings who appear on one list but are omitted from another (see Other King Lists for further information). There are also at least two manuscripts held in the British Museum that contain differing king lists covering the same lineage of monarchs.[109] Budge theorised that the existence of multiple king lists were to due to rival claimants to the throne.[204] Tafari's king list noticeably tries to accommodate all these differing traditions by including the majority of the different kings into one longer line of succession.

Two European missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries, Pedro Páez and Manuel de Almeida, visited Ethiopia and personally saw two different king lists on which they based their respective writings on the history of Ethiopia.[205] The manuscripts likely dated to before 1620.[205] Both Páez and de Almeida stated that the Ethiopian emperor lent them books from the church of Axum containing the king lists.[205] The king lists copied down by Páez and de Almeida include the names of several kings mentioned on Tafari's list as reigning from the 7th to the 10th centuries.

Manuel de Almeida read a book from a church at Axum which included a short list of kings of the Zagwe dynasty. This list states that the kings Yemrehana Krestos, Lalibela and Na'akueto La'ab all reigned for exactly 40 years each, with the last king Harbai reigning for 8 years.[206] These reign lengths match those given by Tafari, suggesting he may have used a similar source for his king list. Manuel de Almeida however stated that "those who knew the history better" said that many kings were missing from this list.[206]

A text known as the "Paris Chronicle" includes a list of kings that closely matches the order of kings numbered 247 to 256 on Tafari's list with the exception of Queen Gudit who is not mentioned on the list.[207] The chronicle dates to the eighteenth century.[205] Because the list matches so closely with Tafari's, it can be assumed that a similar text was used to draw up parts of the king list.

Unpublished sources
It is possible that Tafari's king list includes information gathered from sources that have yet to be published or are in private hands. One unpublished text, simply called the Chronicle of Ethiopia, was in the possession of Qesa Gabaz Takla Haymanot of Aksum.[208] The author of this chronicle collected information from various old chronicles held in a number of different churches and monasteries, and attempted to compile the information in a "harmonic" way.[209] The chronicle covers information from the reign of Menelik I to Menelik II.[209] Some of the known information from this unpublished chronicle does support elements of Tafari's list.

Kebra Nagast
See also: Kebra Nagast

Illustration accompanying an edition of the Kebra Nagast.
It is likely the author of the 1922 king list used the Kebra Nagast for information regarding the beginnings of the Solomonic dynasty. The text, also known as The Glory of the Kings, tells of how the Queen of Sheba (Makeda) met King Solomon of Israel, their son Menelik I and how the Ark of the Covenant came to Ethiopia.

The origins of the Kebra Nagast are obscure. A popular belief is that it was written in the 13th or 14th century to legitimise the ruling Solomonic dynasty.[210] However, some historians have suggested that it was written in the 6th century to glorify the Axumite king Kaleb.[210] Another hypothesis is that was written before the birth of Christ.[211] The original language of the Kebra Nagast before it was translate into Ge'ez is also debated, with arguments for Arabic, Coptic or other Semitic language origins all being suggested.[210] Old Testament scholar David Allan Hubbard identified Patristic, Qur'anic, Rabbinical and Aporcyphal texts as sources for the Kebra Nagast.[212] The Kebra Nagast itself claims that the original text was found by the Archbishop of Rome (i.e. Constantinople) in the Church of Saint Sophia and that he read the manuscript claimed the world belonged to the Emperor of Rome and the Emperor of Ethiopia.[213]


Illustration accompanying an edition of the Kebra Nagast.
The colophon of the Kebra Nagast claims that the text was translated from Arabic in the 14th century during the reign of Amda Seyon I (r. 1314–1344).[211] However, some historians have been suspicious of this statement and have suggested that the authors of the original text itself were Ethiopian scribes.[211] Historian Stuart Munro-Hay stated that there is no record of Ethiopian monarchs claiming descent from Solomon before the 13th century.[211]

Historian Gizachew Tiruneh felt that it was most likely that the text was written in the 6th century and was written by Monophysite Christians in Ethiopia.[212] He noted that the Solomonic dynasty had been well established by the 14th century and felt that it was unlikely they would need to be legitimised by this period.[214] Tiruneh also noted that the Kebra Nagast ends with a story that took place in c. 525, when Kaleb of Axum defeated the Jewish king in south Arabia.[214] He also pointed out there was no mention of Islam in the text, despite Muslim incursions into Ethiopia and its neighbours having taken place by this time.[214] Tiruneh further noted that the story of Menelik, son of Makeda and Solomon, was known as far back as the 10th century A.D. in the Alexandrian Church.[214]

Biblical influences

The Queen of Sheba meets King Solomon of Israel, from an illustration accompanying a copy of the Kebra Nagast.
Various Biblical figures are included in this king list. Three of Noah's descendants are named as founders of the first three dynasties; Aram, Ham and Joktan. Gether, son of Aram, and Cush, son of Ham, are both also included as kings on this list. Descendants of Cush named Sabtah, Seba and Sabtechah are also named as kings of Ethiopia. Other Biblical figures include Nimrod, son of Cush, and the Queen of Sheba, whom Ethiopians call "Makeda". Zerah the Cushite may also be included on Tafari's king list under the name "Sera" which is used for two different kings on the list.

According to Ethiopian tradition Makeda was an ancestor of the Solomonic dynasty and mother of Menelik I, whose father was king Solomon of Israel. E. A. Wallis Budge believed that the queen was more likely to have been from Yemen or Hadhramaut than from Ethiopia.[18] He also believed that the tradition of the Queen of Sheba entered the region of modern-day Ethiopia when it was conquered by a Yemeni tribe called the "Habasha", who were "the first to introduce civilization into the country", as theorized by Carlo Conti Rossini.[18] Budge also thought it was possible that the story was introduced via Jewish traders who settled in Abyssinia/Ethiopia.[18] However, by the early 21st century the theory of a south Arabian or 'Sabaean' origin for Ethiopian civilization was largely abandoned by scholars,[215] and thus some of Budge's ideas would now be considered outdated.

The Biblical events of the flood and the fall of the Tower of Babel are both included in the chronology of the king list, dated respectively to 3244 B.C. and 2713 B.C., with the 531-year period in between listed as an interregnum where no kings reigned.

Another Biblical story included is that of the Ethiopian eunuch, named Jen Daraba according to this king list, who visited Jerusalem during the reign of the 169th sovereign Queen Garsemot Kandake VI. However, the version of the story presented by Tafari has some major inaccuracies such as mistakenly stating that Philip the Apostle baptised the eunuch when it was actually Philip the Evangelist according to the Bible.

Coptic and Arabic influences

1760 Coptic prayer book written in Arabic.
The first dynasty of Tafari's list, the Tribe of Ori, is almost certainly taken from medieval Coptic and Arabic texts on the kings of Egypt who ruled before the Great Flood. French historian Louis J. Morié, in his 1904 book Histoire de L'Ethiopie, recorded an almost identical list of kings and queens to those found on the first dynasty of Tafari's list.[32] Morié stated that the king list he saw was recorded by the Copts in their annals and was found in both Coptic and Arabic tradition.[216] He however felt that the Egyptian Delta would not have been habitable in the Antediluvian era and thus theorized that these kings ruled Thebes and "Ethiopia" (i.e. Nubia).[217] Morié noted that there had originally been a list of 40 kings, but only 19 of them had been preserved up to the early 20th century.[217] He believed that the king list originated from the works of Murtada ibn al-Afif, an Arab writer from the 12th century who wrote a number of works, though only one, titled The Prodigies of Egypt, has partially survived to the present day.[217][218] The Coptic king list begins with Aram, son of Shem, in the same way that Tafari's king list begins with Aram, otherwise known as Ori on the 1922 king list.[217]

A medieval Arab text called Akhbar al-Zaman (The History of Time), dated to between 940 and 1140, may have been an earlier version of the king list Morié saw.[219] The authorship is unknown, but may have been written by historian Al-Masudi based on earlier Arab, Christian and Greek sources.[219] Another possible author is Ibrahim ibh Wasif Shah who lived during the Twelfth century.[219] The text contained a list of kings of Egypt who ruled before the Great Flood and shows some similarities with the list of kings of the "Tribe of Ori or Aram" included on Tafari's list, who also ruled before the Great Flood. Several kings show similarities in names and chronological order, though not all kings on one list appear on the other. The kings included on Akhbar al-Zaman are not archeologically verified and do not appear on any ancient Egyptian king lists.

A number of Coptic monks from Egypt came to Ethiopia in the 13th century and brought with them many books written in Coptic and Arabic.[220] These monks also translated many works into Ge'ez.[220] It is possible that the legends from Akhbar al-Zaman may have entered Ethiopia during this time.

Manfred Kropp theorized that the 1922 Ethiopian king list may have been influenced by the works of Ibn al-Rāhib, a 13th-century Coptic historian whose works were translated into Ge'ez by Ethiopian writer Enbaqom in the 16th century, and Jirjis al-Makin Ibn al-'Amid, another 13th century Coptic historian whose work Al-Majmu' al-Mubarak (The Blessed Collection) was also translated around the same time.[221] Both writers partially based their information on ancient history from the works of Julius Africanus and through him quote the historical traditions of Egypt as recorded by Manetho.[221] Jirgis was known as "Wälda-Amid" in Ethiopia.[221] Kropp believed that some of the names of the early part of Tafari's king list were taken from a king list included within Jirgis' text which draws upon traditions from Manetho and the Old Testament.[222]

Ancient Egyptian and Nubian influences

Reconstructions of six statues of Kushite kings discovered at Dukki-Gel in Sudan.
Many of the Egyptian and Nubian monarchs included on the list are historically verified but are not proven to have ruled the area of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea, and often have reign dates that do no match dates used by modern-day archaeologists. The rulers numbered 88 to 96 on the list are the High Priests of Amun who ruled Upper Egypt during the time of the Twenty-first dynasty, whose influence was limited to Lower Egypt. The order of the priests on the list is mostly confirmed by archaeology, though their rule did not extend to modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea. Several other kings on the list have names that are clearly influenced by those of Egyptian pharaohs such as Senefrou (8), Tutimheb (53), Amen Emhat I (63), Amen Emhat II (83), Amen Hotep Zagdur (102), Aksumay Ramissu (103) and Apras (127).

Numerous Nubian rulers from the Kushite kingdom in modern-day Sudan are also included on Tafari's king list. In particular, most of the pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who ruled over both Nubia and Egypt, are listed as part of the dynasty of Menelik I. However, the Kushite Pharaohs are not known to have ruled much further south than the area of modern-day South Sudan. Kushite monarchs from after the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty of Egypt are also occasionally mentioned on this list, specifically Aktisanes, Aspelta, Harsiotef, Nastasen, Arakamani and Arqamani. Additionally, there are six queens on this list who are referred to as "Kandake", the Meroitic term for the king's sister used by the rulers of Kush. Apart from the monarchs listed above, there were also some Viceroys of Kush who ruled over Nubia during the time of the New Kingdom after Egypt conquered the Kingdom of Kerma in c. 1500 BC. Some of the names on Tafari's king list may be based on these Viceroys of Kush, including the aforementioned High Priests of Amun.


The Axumite empire at its maximum extent of influence.
Louis J. Morié's Histoire de l'Éthiopie is the most likely source for these Egyptian and Nubian monarchs and the regnal order they are presented in on the 1922 Ethiopian king list, as noted above.[26] However, there may also be other reasons why the author of this king list felt that the inclusion of Egyptian and Nubian monarchs was appropriate for a historical outline of Ethiopia/Abyssinia. One reason may be due to the Axumite conquest of Meroë, the last capital of the Kingdom of Kush, by King Ezana in c. 325 AD.[223] It was from this point onward that the Axumites began referring to themselves as "Ethiopians", the Greco-Roman term previously used largely for the Kushites.[224] Following this, the inhabitants of Axum (modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea) were able to claim lineage from the "Ethiopians" or "Aethiopians" mentioned in the Bible, including the Kandakes, who were actually Kushites. The claiming of the term "Ethiopian" by the Axumites may, however, pre-date Christianity. For example, Axumite king Ezana is called "King [...] of the Ethiopians" on a Greek inscription where he also calls himself "son of the invincible Mars", suggesting that this pre-dates his conversion to Christianity.[225] The inclusion of Kushite rulers on the king list suggests that the traditions of ancient Nubia were considered culturally compatible with those of Axum.[226] Makeda, the biblical Queen of Sheba, was referred to as "Candace" or "Queen Mother" in the Kebra Nagast,[227] suggesting a cultural connection between Ethiopia and the ancient kingdom of Kush. Portuguese missionary Francisco Álvares, who travelled to Ethiopia in 1520, recorded one Ethiopian tradition which claimed that Yeha was "the favourite residence of Queen Candance, when she honoured the country with her presence".[228]

There are also some pieces of archaeological evidence that shows connections between ancient Nubia and Abyssinia. Some Nubian objects from the Napatan and Meroitic periods have been found in Ethiopian/Abyssinian graves dating to the 8th to 2nd centuries BC.[229] There have also been discoveries of red-orange sherds similar to those from the pre-Axumite period in sites of the Jebel Mokram Group in Sudan, showing contacts along caravan routes toward the Nile Valley in the 1st millennium BC.[230] This shows that interactions between Nubia and modern day Ethiopia long pre-date the Axumite conquest. Archaeologist Rodolfo Fattovich believed that the people of the pre-Axumite culture had contacts with the kingdom of Kush, the Achaemenid Empire and the Greeks, but that these contacts were "mostly indirect".[231]


Stele with Egyptian hieroglyphs found in Axum, as shown in James Bruce's Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile.
Scottish traveler James Bruce, in his multi-volume work Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile included a drawing of a stele found in Axum and brought back to Gondar by the Ethiopian emperor.[232] The stele had carved figures of Egyptian gods and was inscribed with hieroglyphs.[232] E. A. Wallis Budge believed the stele to be a "Cippi of Horus" which were placed in homes and temples to keep evil spirits away.[232] He noted that these date from the end of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (c. 664–525 BC) onwards.[232] Budge believed this was proof of contacts between Egypt and Axum in the early 4th century BC.[232] Archaeological excavations in the Kassala region have also revealed direct contact with Pharaonic Egypt.[233] Some tombs excavated in the Yeha region, the likely capital of the Dʿmt kingdom, contained imported albastron dated to c. 770–404 B.C. which had a Napatan or Egyptian origin.[234]


The world according to Herodotus. He defined "Aethiopes" as being south of Egypt and including Meroe.
The earliest known Greek writings that mention "Aethiopians" date to the 8th century BC, in the writings of Homer and Hesiod. Herodotus, in his work Histories (c. 430 BC), defined "Aethiopia" as beginning at the island of Elephantine and including all land south of Egypt, with the capital being Meroe.[235] This geographical definition confirms that in ancient times the term "Aethiopia" was commonly used to refer to Nubia and the Kingdom of Kush rather than modern day Ethiopia. The first writer to use the name "Ethiopia" for the region of the Kingdom of Axum was Philostorgius around 440 AD.[236]

Budge theorised that one of the reasons why the name "Ethiopia" was applied to Abyssinia was because Syrian monks identified Kush and Nubia with Abyssinia when translating the Bible from Greek to Ge'ez.[237] Budge further noted that translators of the Bible into Greek identified Kush with Ethiopia and this was carried over into the translation from Greek to Ge'ez.[238] Louis J. Morié likewise believed the adoption of the word "Ethiopia" by the Abyssinians was due to their desire to search for their origins in the Bible and coming across the word "Ethiopia" in Greek translations.[239] Budge argued that it was unlikely that the "Ethiopians" mentioned in ancient Greek writings were the Abyssinians, but instead were far more likely to be the Nubians of Meroë.[240] He believed that the native name of the region around Axum was "Habesh" from which "Abyssinia" is derived and originating in the name of the Habasha tribe from southern Arabia.[238] He did note however that the modern day people of the region did not like this term and preferred the name "Ethiopia" due to its association with Kush.[238]

The ancient Nubians are not known to have used the term "Ethiopian" to refer to themselves, however Silko, the first Christian Nubian king of Nobatia, in the early sixth century described himself as "Chieftain of the Nobadae and of all the Ethiopians".[241]


Taharqa, Nubian pharaoh of Kush and Egypt from 690 to 664 BC.
Budge noted that none of the Egyptian and Nubian kings appear on other known king lists from Ethiopia.[125] He believed that contemporary Ethiopian priests had been "reading a modern European History of Egypt" and had incorporated in the king list Egyptian pharaohs who had "laid Nubia and other parts of the Sudan under tribute", as well as the names of various Kushite kings and Priest kings.[242] To support his argument, he stated that while the names of Abyssinian kings have meanings, the names of Egyptian kings would be meaningless if translated into the Ethiopian language.[19] Historian Manfred Kropp likewise noted that no Ethiopian manuscript prior to Tafari's king list included names of monarchs resembling those used by ancient Egyptian rulers.[7]

A comparison of Tafari's list with other known Ethiopian king lists shows that most of the kings on Tafari's list with Egyptian or Nubian names do not have these elements in their names on the other king lists (see Alternate King lists from Menelik I to Bazen). For example, the 102nd king on Tafari's list, Amen Hotep Zagdur, only appears as "Zagdur" on one British Museum manuscript and on Rossini's list.[111] The next king, Aksumay Ramissu, is only known as "Aksumay" on the same two lists.[111] The 106th king, Abralyus Wiyankihi II, only appears as "Abralyus" on the same manuscript.[111] The 111th king, Tsawi Terhak Warada Nagash, is a combination of multiple kings. One king named "Sawe" or "Za Tsawe" is listed as the fifth king following Menelik I, according to one British Museum manuscript and the lists recorded by Bruce and Salt.[109] Another king named "Warada Nagash" is named as the eighth king following Menelik I on a different manuscript.[111] No known list includes both kings, and Tafari's list combined the two different kings as a single entry, with the addition of the name "Terhak", to be equated with the Nubian pharaoh Taharqa, who otherwise does not appear on other Ethiopian king lists.[111] Taharqa's inclusion on the king list ties in with the mention of his name in the Hebrew Bible (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), where he was described as the "King of Ethiopia", in reference to Kush in modern-day Sudan.[243] Also missing from other Ethiopian king lists are the six "Kandake" queens numbered 110, 135, 137, 144, 162 and 169. It is likely that these queens refer to the reigning female monarchs of Kush, although it is unclear who exactly they are based on as their names do not match any known queens of Kush. The second Kandake queen, Nikawla (no. 135), has a name which was sometimes used in medieval times to the refer to the Queen of Sheba.[244]


Herihor, High Priest of Amun of Upper Egypt between c. 1080 and 1074 BC, shown here with wife Nodjmet.
The inclusion of the High Priests of Amun who ruled Upper Egypt between c. 1080 and 943 B.C. can be directly traced to Louis J. Morié's Histoire de l'Éthiopie.[26] The association between these Egyptian High Priests and Aethiopia was particularly strong in European Egyptological writings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During this period, several major Egyptologists (such as Heinrich Brugsch, James Breasted and George Reisner) believed that the rise of the Kush kingdom was due to the influence of the High Priests of Amun moving into Nubia towards the end of the Twentieth Dynasty because of political conflict arising at the end of the New Kingdom.[245] Brugsch in particular entertained the idea that the early Kushite kings were lineal descendants of the priests from Egypt, though this was explicitly rejected by Breasted.[246] Later Egyptologists A. J. Arkell and Walter Emery theorized that a priestly "government in exile" had influenced the Kushite kingdom.[247] Budge himself would agree with these ideas and suggested that the High Priests of Amun moved south to Nubia due to the rise of the Libyan pharaohs in Lower Egypt, and consolidated their high position by intermarrying with Nubian women.[248] Budge further theorised that the name of the Nubian pharaoh Piye or "Piankhi" was taken from that of the High Priest of Amun Piankh and he was possibly Piankh's descendant.[249] Such ideas around the Kushite monarchy originating from this specific line of priests are now considered outdated, but the popularity of these theories in the early 20th century explains their inclusion, in almost exact chronological order, on Tafari's king list from 1922.

Greek influences

6th century B.C. Greek black-figure vase showing Memnon leaving for Troy.
The ancient Greek mythical queen of Aethiopia, Cassiopeia, is claimed as part of Ethiopia's ancient history according to Tafari's list, which lists her as the 49th monarch and the third of the Agdazyan dynasty. Her grandson Electryon also makes an appearance on this list, though oddly he is placed six centuries before Cassiopeia, as part of the Tribe of Kam. Cassiopeia's husband, Cepheus also makes an appearance on the king list, but is numbered 71st and is dated to over 400 years after her reign. These discrepancies stem from the narrative of Louis J. Morié's Histoire de l'Éthiopie, which at times can be confusing, such as in the case where he claimed that two separate queens named Cassiopeia existed at different times.[55][57] Morié's book also influenced the inclusion of Memnon, a mythical king of "Aethiopia" who fought in the Trojan War, under the name "Amen Emhat II", with his father Tithonus included under the name "Titon Satiyo".[126]

However, the author of the 1922 Ethiopian king list did include additional figures who were not part of Morié's original narrative. The legendary Cretian king Minos is listed as the 66th monarch under the name "Mandes", a variation of the name used by Diodorus in his work Bibliotheca Historia,[69] though oddly he was listed as a king of Egypt in Diodorus' text rather than Crete. Diodorus' text seems to have influenced other parts of the king list, such as the 122th monarch named "Sabakon" (an alternate name for the Nubian pharaoh Shabaka, who is already mentioned earlier in the list) and the 127th monarch named "Apras", the Greek name for Egyptian pharaoh Wahibre Haaibre.

In addition to the above, the Egyptian king Proteus is also included on the list as part of the Agdazyan dynasty, however he only appears in Greek writings and is otherwise unattested in the Egyptian archaeological record.

Conflict with other Ethiopian traditions

Abreha and Atsbeha
Tafari's list occasionally does not match with other Ethiopian traditions. One example is Abreha and Atsbeha, who are believed by Ethiopians to have been two brothers who brought Christianity to Ethiopia. However, Tafari lists 'Abreha Atsbeha' as a single monarch numbered 201st on his list and as a son of queen Sofya. In reality, the son of Sofya was king Ezana who was the first Christian king of Axum. Ezana is however placed much later in the list, over 150 years after the reign of Sofya. Queen Sofya ruled as a regent for her son Ezana, though Tafari considers her to be a reigning monarch in her own right, even allowing for her regency to be counted as a period of co-rule with her son. The listing of 'Abreha Atsbeha' as a single figure may be a transcribable error, as Aleka Taye's version of the king list clearly states that 'Abreha' and 'Atsbeha' are two separate individuals.[10]

Another example is that of king Angabo I, who is placed in the middle of the Agdazyan dynasty on the 1922 king list. However some Ethiopian legends claim that this king was the founder of a new dynasty.[251] In both cases the dating is given as the late 14th century BC.

E. A. Wallis Budge noted that there were differing versions of the chronological order of the Ethiopian kings, with some lists stating that a king named Aithiopis was the first to rule while other lists claim that the first king was Adam.[252] Tafari's list instead begins with Aram.

The list also has its own internal conflicting information. Tafari claims that it was during the reign of the 169th monarch, queen Garsemot Kandake VI, in the first century AD when Christianity was formally introduced to Ethiopia. However, this is in direct conflict with the story of the later queen Sofya, who ruled 249 years later.

List of monarchs
Gregorian Dates: Tafari's king list uses dates according to the Ethiopian Calendar. According to Charles Fernand Rey, one can estimate the Gregorian date equivalent by adding a further seven or eight years to the date.[253] As an example, he states that 1 AD on the Ethiopian calendar would be 8 AD on the Gregorian calendar.[253] He notes that the calendar of Ethiopia likely changed in some ways throughout history but argued that this was a good enough method for estimates.[253] E. A. Wallis Budge stated that the Ethiopian calendar was 8 years behind the Gregorian calendar from 1 January to 10 September and 7 years behind from 11 September to 31 December.[16]

The first dynasty of Tafari's king list consists of 21 monarchs who ruled before the Biblical "Great Flood". This dynasty is almost certainly legendary and borrowed from a list of pre-flood kings of Egypt that is found in Coptic and Arab texts. French historian Louis J. Morié recorded a similar list of 19 monarchs in his 1904 book Histoire de L'Éthiopie.[32] These kings are not archeologically verified and it is likely that the stories around them developed in later times. The medieval Arab text Akhbar al-Zaman contains a king list that may have been an earlier version of the list Morié saw centuries later. This list contained a total of 19 kings and the majority had similar names to those found on the later version in 1904 (See the Akhbar al-Zaman section of this article for more information on this text).[219] Morié noted that the kings were supposed to be rulers of Egypt, but believed that they had actually ruled what he referred to as "Ethiopia", although he specifically was writing about Nubia.[32] He pointed to a story of the third king, Gankam, who had a palace built beyond the Equator at the Mountains of the Moon, as proof that these kings resided in Aethiopia.[255][218] The kings of this dynasty are described as Priest-kings in Coptic tradition and were called the "Soleyman" dynasty.[218] Louis J. Morié may well have been the inspiration behind the appropriation of this legendary Egyptian dynasty into the Ethiopian king list as his book shows clear influence over the next two dynasties of this king list.[26] While the original Coptic tradition called the first king "Aram", this king list calls the king "Ori or Aram". The name "Ori" may have originated from Morié's claim that this dynasty was called the "Aurites", and that Aram had inspired the name of his country, which was called "Aurie" or "Aeria".[42]

The "Soleyman" dynasty was said to have been "Priest-kings" who ruled before the Great Flood for 9,000 years, though Morié personally believed the period of rule was closer to 2,000 years.[217] Their capital city was called either "Fanoun" or "Kanoun" and they ruled over much of North and East Africa according to Coptic legend.[217] They also founded other cities named "Gevherabad" (capital of the province of "Schadoukiam"), "Ambarabad" (or "Anbarabad") and "Gabkar" and used a now lost language called "Bialban".[217]

Due to its non-native origin, the tradition of the Ori/Aram dynasty has often been treated as irrelevant to wider Ethiopian tradition. Ethiopian writer and foreign minister Heruy Wolde Selassie ignored this dynasty in his book Wazema.[9] Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa, in his book Ethiopia's 5,000-year history, completely omitted this dynasty and instead begins with the Ham/Kam dynasty.[256] In his book Regents of Nations, Peter Truhart described this dynasty as "non-historical".[257]

Other Ethiopian traditions name a completely different line of kings as the first to rule Ethiopia. Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge stated that in his time the contemporary Ethiopians could not "tell us [anything] about the reigns of their [pre-Flood] kings" and relied on Biblical genealogy for a list of names.[258] The list that Budge provided for the pre-Flood kings varies considerably from the one on Tafari's list (see Other King Lists section below), essentially using the Biblical genealogy from Adam to Solomon.[259] Budge noted that some Ethiopian king lists stretched back to 5500 B.C. (the year the world was believed by the Ethiopians to have been created) and began with Adam.[3] Other Ethiopian traditions instead state that the Ethiopians descend from Ham, a grandson of Noah.[260] There are some brief king lists that outline a genealogy from Ham and his son Cush to kings representing Ethiopia and Axum.[261]

By contrast, Tafari's list names neither Adam or Ham as the founder of the Ethiopian line, but instead chooses Aram, son of Shem, a grandson of Noah, to be the "great ancestor" of the Ethiopian monarchy.[262] E. A. Wallis Budge believed that the reason for this was because contemporary Ethiopians wanted to distance themselves from Ham and the Curse of Ham.[262] The Curse of Ham had been used as an ideological justification for the Atlantic slave trade during the 16th to 19th centuries.[263] Likewise, it was also used to justify the European Scramble for Africa during the 1880s to 1910s, when nearly 90 percent of Africa was colonized by European powers and Ethiopia was one of only two countries to remain independent (the other being Liberia). The medieval Ethiopian text Kebra Nagast stated that "God decreed sovereignty for the seed of Shem, and slavery for the seed of Ham".[262] The original writer of Tafari's king list appears to have deliberately relegated Ham to being the founder of the second Ethiopian dynasty instead of the first dynasty as was done on older king lists.

The only rulers of this dynasty who do not originate from the Coptic Antediluvian king list are "Senefrou" and "Assa", which E. A. Wallis Budge equated with the Egyptian pharaohs Sneferu and Djedkare Isesi. The historical reign dates of these pharaohs are far later than what is stated on this king list. Their inclusion as rulers of Ethiopia may be due to some kind of interaction with Nubia (i.e. "Aethiopia").

One issue with the Ori dynasty is that the king list dates the Great Flood to 3244 B.C. and yet states that Aram, who was born after the Flood, ruled over 1,200 years before it took place. This also causes problems with the dating given for Gether and Nimrod who both lived after the Flood.

Son of Shem in Biblical tradition.[262]
The Coptic tradition of the "Soleyman" dynasty however names Aram as a son of Adam.[160]
The reason why this king list calls this king "Ori or Aram" may be due to Louis J. Morié's claim that this dynasty was called the "Aurites", and that Aram had inspired the name of his country, called "Aurie" or "Aeria".[42]
Alternatively, the use of the name "Ori" may have used because of the Biblical genealogy from Adam to Solomon written in the Kebra Nagast, which includes an additional king named "Orni" whose identity remains unclear and is placed directly before Aram.[264]

"Total: 21 sovereigns of the Tribe of Ori."[254]
Interregnum (531 years)

Painting of the Tower of Babel by Abel Grimmer (1604).
"From the Deluge until the fall of the Tower of Babel".[267]

This 531-year period is the only gap in Tafari's king list where no monarchs are named. Tafari leaves this gap unexplained, but some older Ethiopian king lists state that the monarchs who reigned between the Great Flood and the fall of the Tower of Babel were pagans, idolators and worshippers of the "serpent", and thus were not worthy to be named.[262]

The Tower of Babel was, according to the Bible, built by humans in Shinar at a time when humanity spoke a single language. The tower was intended to reach the sky, but this angered God, who confounded their speech and made them unable to understand each other and caused humanity to be scattered across the world. This story serves as an origin myth to explain why so many different languages are spoken around the world. The builder of the Tower, Nimrod, reigned 1,063 years before it fell according to this king list.

The dating of the fall of the tower to directly before the beginning of the Kam dynasty suggests that it was at this point that Ham came to Aethiopia and became its king.

Tribe of Kam (728 years)

1913 map of the earliest-known civilizations by Edward Sylvester Ellis.
See also: Ham (son of Noah)
"Sovereignty of the tribe of Kam after the fall of the tower of Babel."[267]

This dynasty begins with the second son of the Biblical prophet Noah, Ham, whose descendants populated the African continent and adjoining parts of Asia according to Biblical tradition. Ham was the father of Cush (Kush/Nubia), Mizraim (Egypt), Canaan (Levant) and Put (Libya or Punt). One of Ham's descendants, Nimrod, is named as part of the previous dynasty which raises questions over how closely Tafari's Ethiopian king list is following Biblical tradition.

According to Heruy Wolde Selassie's book Wazema, the Kamites originated from the Middle East and conquered Axum, Meroe, Egypt and North Africa.[268]

Most Ethiopian traditions present a very different line of kings descending from Ham. E. A. Wallis Budge stated that in his time there was a common belief in Ethiopia that the people were descended from Ham, his son Cush and Cush's son Ethiopis, who is not named in the Bible, but from whom the country of Ethiopia gets its name.[269] Budge however found it doubtful that the Kushites were the first to inhabit the region of modern-day Ethiopia.[269] Nonetheless, Ham has often been considered the founder of Ethiopia according to many Ethiopian king lists. Some lists explicitly state the names "Ethiopia" and "Axum" come from descendants of Ham that are not named in the Bible.[261] See Alternate Hamitic dynasty section below for more information.

Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa's book Ethiopia's 5,000-year history begins this dynasty with Noah and omits Habassi, but otherwise has a similar line of kings as this list.[256] Heruy Wolde Selassie omitted the first three rulers of this dynasty in his book Wazema and begins the dynasty with Sebtah in 2545 BC.[9]

Peter Truhart, in his book Regents of Nations, dated the monarchs of this dynasty to 2585–1930 BC and stated that the capital during this period was called 'Mazez'.[257] He believed that the first king Kam was a representation of Egypt (or "K.mt") and a reference to Egyptian contacts with the Land of Punt (or modern-day Ethiopia as Truhart identifies it) that took place around 3000 BC.[257] He thus identifies king Kout as the first king of this dynasty instead of Kam.[257] Truhart identified the monarchs from Kout to Lakniduga as the "Dynasty of Kush" based at 'Mazez' and ruled from 2585 to 2145 BC,[257] while the monarchs from Manturay to Piori I are listed as the "Kings of Ethiopia and Meroe" who ruled from 2145 to 1930 BC.[250]

Kmt[262]
Kham[257]
Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa provided alternate reign dates for this king of 3500–2787 BC (713 years) and listed Noah as the first king of this dynasty with reign dates of 3844–3500 BC (344 years).[256] Noah does not appear on Tafari's list.
According to French historian Louis J. Morié, Kam/Ham was killed in a battle against the Assyrians 480 years after the Great Flood after attempting to invade their territories, at the age of 576.[270] Morié identified Kam/Ham with the Egyptian god Amun[270] and thus his wife was Mut.[271]
E. A. Wallis Budge theorized that this king's name was actually a reference to "k.mt", the name of Egypt before the Greco-Roman period and noted that some kings of this dynasty had clearly Egyptian-inspired names (such as Amen, Horkam and Ramenpahte).[262]
Peter Truhart identified this king as a son of Noah who migrated to Africa and whose name inspired Egypt's pre-Greco-Roman name "k.mt".[257] He believed this king's inclusion on the king list represented Egyptian contacts with Punt (which he identifies with modern-day Ethiopia) that took place around 3000 B.C.[257]
23	Kout
ኩሳ	2635–2585 B.C.	2865–2915 A.M.	50 years	Cush
Often considered a representation of the Kingdom of Kush in modern-day Sudan. Some translations of the Bible identify Kush with "Ethiopia", leading to the traditional Ethiopian identification with ancient Kush, which is seen throughout this list.
Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa provided alternate reign dates for this king of 2787–2545 B.C. (242 years).[256]
Louis J. Morié claimed that Kout/Cush was the original builder of Axum and settled in Abyssinia after departing from Upper Egypt.[272]
24	Habassi
ሀባሢ	2585–2545 B.C.	2915–2955 A.M.	40 years	Habisi[61]
Habesch[45]
Son of Cush/Kout.[61][44]
Ethiopian sources claim the word "Abyssinia" is derived from the name of this king.[61][257]
While many historians link the word "Abyssinia" with the Arabic word "Habesh", this link was rejected by Ethiopian scholar Aleqa Asras Yenesaw.[61]
Louis J. Morié claimed this king ruled over Axum while other sons of Cush ruled over different regions.[45]
Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa omitted this king from his list of monarchs of the Kam dynasty.[256]

According to Ethiopian writer Aleka Taye, it was during the reign of this queen that the Sinites, descended from Ham, came to Ethiopia. There is an Ethiopian tradition that the Sinites were the ancestors of the Shanqella tribe.[276]
This queen's name could be based on the ancient Egyptian word "Nehesy" meaning "the Nubian".[277]

According to Ethiopian writer Aleka Taye, it was in the 15th year of this king's reign that Canaan's son Arwadi ("the Arvadite") and his wife Entela came to Ethiopia due to a famine in the land of Canaan. There is an Ethiopian tradition that the Qemant tribe is descended from Anayer, a son of Arwadi and Entela.[276]
Louis J. Morié used "Hor-ka-am" as an alternate name for the Egyptian god Horus and identified him with Raamah, son of Cush.[45][278]

Mentu-Ra[250]
Montu?
Louis J. Morié believed that the Iranian god Mithra could be equated with the Egyptian god Montu (or "Mentou-Rai") and was a king of Meroe.[46]
Morié additionally described Manturay and his successor Rakhu as the first legislators of Ethiopia, calling them the "Ethiopian Menes and his son".[46] Morié also believed they regulated the order and ceremonies of the solar cult in Aethiopia.[46]
Peter Truhart named Manturay as the first king of this dynasty to rule in Meroe, following Morié's narrative of Ethiopian history.[250]

Could be the Biblical figure Sabtechah, a son of Cush.
Louis J. Morié equated this king as the Greek mythical figure Cepheus and named him as a direct successor to Manturay and Rakhu.[46] However, Tafari's king list instead identifies Cepheus with Sebi III (no. 71).
Morie also stated that it was during the reign of this king that a Kushite tribe went to Chaldea and lived alongside the Jewish population there.[31]

Menpekhtira[262][250]
E. A. Wallis Budge believed this king's name was based on "Men-pekhti-Ra",[262] the throne name of Ramesses I, who ruled Egypt from 1292 to 1290 BC. Peter Truhart agreed with this identification.[250]

ጲኦሪ	2000–1985 B.C.	3500–3515 A.M.	15 years	Poeri[53]
According to Heruy Wolde Selassie, this king was defeated by Rama (a Hindu god) of India.[268] This narrative was likely inspired by Louis J. Morié and his book Historie de l'Ethiopie, in which he claimed that Rama had a vast empire stretching across India and Arabia and had defeated the Egyptian Pharaoh.[53] According to Morié, the Ethiopian king, "Poeri I", then became a tributary to Rama.[53] While Morié did not make this identification, it is possible that the author of the 1922 Ethiopian king list identified Rama with Raamah, son of Cush and father of Sheba, who founds the next dynasty of this king list.

Note: Historian Manfred Kropp stated the word "Agdazyan" is likely a transcribal error and meant to say "Ag'azyan", as the Ethiopian syllable signs da and 'a are relatively easy to confuse with each other.[280]

The third dynasty of this king list is descended from Joktan, a son of Eber, grandson of Shem and great-grandson of Noah. The first ruler of the dynasty, Akbunas Saba, is likely meant to be Sheba, son of Joktan.[281] The dynasty ends with the famous Queen of Sheba, whose name is Makeda in Ethiopian tradition. According to Genesis 10:7 and 1 Chronicles 1:9, Sheba was a grandson of Cush through Raamah, which provides a link between this Semitic dynasty and the Hamitic dynasty that preceded it. The so-called Agdazyan dynasty includes a number of kings whose names clearly reference ancient Egypt and Kush, most notably the line of High Priests of Amun that reigned near the end of this dynastic period. While most of these monarchs are archaeologically verified, they did not rule modern-day Ethiopia, but rather ruled over or had some contact with ancient Nubia and Kush, which is equated with Ethiopia in some translations of the Bible and these translated editions have influenced modern Ethiopia's belief in an affinity with ancient Nubia.

This section of the king list is heavily influenced by Louis J. Morié's book Histoire de L'Éthiopie, with the majority of monarchs having similar names and line of succession to those found in Morié's book.[282] Much of Morié's book cannot be considered historically accurate, as it was written over a century ago and largely attempts to fit contemporary Egyptological knowledge within the Biblical narrative. Historian Manfred Kropp identified this book as a key source in the creation of the 1922 Ethiopian king list as a whole, and felt that it was more imaginative than scientific in its approach to the history of Aethiopia.[26] Morié's claim that Sabaeans came to Aethiopia during the reign of either pharaoh Pepi I or Pepi II may have inspired the narrative of a "Sabaean" dynasty ruling Ethiopia, as claimed by the 1922 king list.[31]

While this dynasty takes inspiration from foreign sources, it does include some notable kings that developed within indigenous tradition. Specifically, five monarchs are named in native Ethiopian sources as rulers from distant ancient times, these being Angabo I (no. 74), who founded a new dynasty after killing the serpent king Arwe, and his successors Zagdur I (no. 77), Za Sagado (no. 80), Tawasya Dews (no. 97) and Makeda (no. 98), the last of whom is identified with the Queen of Sheba (See Angabo dynasty for more information).[283][284] The 1922 king list incorporates these five rulers within the longer narrative of Louis J. Morié. There is also another king named Ethiopis, who Ethiopian tradition credits with inspiring the name of the country Ethiopia.

The word Ag'azyan means "free" or "to lead to freedom" in Ge'ez.[285][268] According to Heruy Wolde Selassie in his book Wazema, this originated from the liberation of Ethiopia from the rule of the Kamites/Hamites.[268] Selassie also claimed that three of Joktan's sons divided Ethiopia between themselves.[268] Sheba received Tigray, Obal received Adal and Ophir received Ogaden.[268] If this is to be believed, then presumably the later monarchs who followed Sheba/Akbunas Saba ruled from the Tigray Region. It is unclear who ruled the other territories and whether they ever came under rule of the Tigrayian monarchs in later times. It is possible that Sheba/Akbunas Saba may have conquered the other territories and thus became king of all of Ethiopia.

E. A. Wallis Budge had a different theory of the origin of the term Aga'azyan, believing that it referred to several tribes that migrated from Arabia to Africa either at the same time as or after the Habashat had migrated.[285] He stated that the word "Ge'ez" had come from "Ag'azyian".[285] The term "Agdazyan" may also refer to the Agʿazi region of the Axumite empire located in modern-day Eastern Tigray and Southern Eritrea

Sheba is usually considered by historians to have been the south Arabian kingdom of Saba, in an area that later became part of the Aksumite Empire. The Kebra Nagast however specifically states that Sheba was located in Ethiopia.[286] This has led to some historians arguing that Sheba may have been located in a region in Tigray and Eritrea, which was once called "Saba".[287] American historian Donald N. Levine suggested that Sheba may be linked with the historical region of Shewa, where the modern Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa is located.[288] Additionally, a Sabaean connection with Ethiopia is evidenced by a number of settlements on the Red Sea coast that emerged around 500 BC and were influenced by Sabaean culture.[289] These people were traders and had their own writing script.[289] Gradually over time their culture merged with that of the local people.[289][290] The Sabaean language was likely the official language of northern Ethiopia during the pre-Axumite period (c. 500 BC to 100 AD).[291]


Ancient blocks from Yeha, the likely capital of D'mt, with Sabaean inscriptions.
Some historians believe that the kingdom of Dʿmt was Sabaean-influenced, possibly due to Sabaean dominance of the Red Sea or due to mixing with the indigenous population.[292][293] D'mt had developed by the first millennium B.C. in modern-day northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, and had "a veneer of cultural affinities adopted largely from the Saba'an culture centred across the Red Sea in the area of modern Yemen".[294] The D'mt area had a written language that appeared "almost entirely Saba'an in origin".[234] Historian Jacke Phillips argued that "some form of underlying political unification must have allowed its dispersal".[234]

Older hypotheses on the origin of the pre-Axumite culture suggested that it developed due to migrations of population from south Arabia in pre-modern times or that there had been some kind of Sabaean colonization of the modern-day Ethiopia/Eritrea region.[295] More recent theories instead suggest that the culture developed out of a long process of contacts dating back to the 2nd millennium BC.[295]

Taking into account the proof of Sabaean-Ethiopian contacts, this dynasty, while likely legendary, is nonetheless a clear reference to the historical interactions with southern Arabia that occurred in the ancient past and influenced Ethiopian culture and tradition. The mix of Egyptian, Nubian, Greek and Biblical figures in this dynasty showcases the many cultural interactions that Ethiopians had with their neighbours.


Depiction of Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, from an Ethiopian Chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Roman-Jewish historian Josephus wrote that that Achaemenid king Cambyses II conquered the capital of Aethiopia and changed its name from "Saba" to "Meroe".[296] Josephus also stated the Queen of Sheba came from this region and was queen of both Egypt and Ethiopia.[297] This suggests that a belief in a connection between Sheba and Kush was already in place by the 1st century AD. Josephus also associated Sheba/Saba with Kush when describing a campaign led by Moses against the Ethiopians, in which he won and later married Tharbis, the daughter of the king of 'Saba' or Meroe.

Due to the alleged Sabaean origin of this dynasty, it is possible that some of the names of kings may be drawn from a south Arabian tradition that identifies a legendary figure named Qahtan (ancestor of the Qahtanite Arabs) with the Biblical figure Joktan.[298][268] The Arab genealogy from Joktan names his great-grandson as Saba (representing the Sabaean kingdom or "Sheba") and his great-great-grandson Kahlan (who represents an Arab confederation in Ancient Yemen). Saba and Kahlan may be represented by the first two kings of this dynasty, Akbunas Saba and Nakehte Kalnis, due to the similarity of their names.

This dynasty is notable for including a line of Egyptian High Priests of Amun numbered 88 to 96 which closely matches archaeological evidence but is not entirely correct. Manfred Kropp felt that these monarchs were the clearest borrowings from Egyptological knowledge and he theorized that Heruy Wolde Selassie deliberately altered the chronological order when writing this king list.[299]

Peter Truhart, in his book Regents of Nations, dated the kings from Akbunas Saba II to Lakndun Nowarari to 1930–1730 BC and listed them as a continuation of the line of "Kings of Ethiopia and Meroe" that begun in 2145 BC.[250] However, Truhart's king list then jumps forward and dates the kings from Tutimheb onwards as contemporaries of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties of Egypt, with a date range of 1552–1185 BC.[250] Truhart also identified modern-day Ethiopia with the Land of Punt.[250] His list however omits the High Priests of Amun from Herihor to Pinedjem II without giving a clear reason.[126] Despite this, he still acknowledges the rule of the High Priests in Thebes as taking place from c. 1080 to 990 BC.[126]

Kesayopi[10]
Kasiopo[250]
Despite sharing a name with Cassiopeia, a queen of Aethiopia in Ancient Greek myth who was the wife of Cepheus and mother of Andromeda, Louis J. Morié's original narrative differentiates this queen from the more well-known Cassiopeia/"Kasiyope".[59] Instead, "Kasiyope I" is the name given to an otherwise unnamed queen of Ethiopia who plotted the assassination of Osiris with Set according to one version of the Osiris myth recounted by Plutarch.[56]

Aethiopis[61]
Atew[62][250]
Ityepis[250]
Itiyopp'is[301][268]
This king's name references the ancient Greek word "Aethiopia", which was originally used to denote Sub-Saharan Africa, though often more specifically the Nubian people.
Ethiopian legend claims that "Ethiopia" is derived from the name of king Ethiopis.[300] Likewise, Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder believed that the word "Aethiopia"/"Ethiopia" came from a king named Aethiopis, who was the son of the Roman god Vulcan.[61]
Some Ethiopian traditions trace the word "Ethiopia" to Itan, a Ge'ez word for incense, a reference to the Ethiopian plateau which has long traded in incense.[61]
One tradition states that Etiyopus was a son of Cush and grandson of Kam.[61]
Another tradition additionally claims that Etiyopus' son was named Aksumawi, and he had a son named Malayka Aksum, who then had six sons named Sum, Nafas, Bagi'o, Kuduki, Akhoro and Farheba.[260] The names of Etiyopus' son, grandson and great-grandson are not found on Tafari's king list.
According to the Book of Axum, this king built Ethiopia's first capital, Mazaber.[302]
Some Ethiopian king lists claim this king was the first to rule Ethiopia.[303]
One tradition states Etiyopus was buried in Aksum and that fire used to burn in his grave.[304]
52	Lakndun Nowarari
ላከንዱን ኖወር አሪ	1800–1770 B.C.	3700–3730 A.M.	30 years	Lakendun Nowar Ori[268]
Lakundu Neworos[10]
Laknidun Nowarawi[250]
Arwe[250]
Newer-Ari[250]
Nower-Ari[62]
Louis J. Morié claimed this king was the father of the Egyptian queen Ahmose-Nefertari.[62] In reality, her father was the Egyptian pharaoh Seqenenre Tao.
Peter Truhart seemingly identified this king with the mythical serpent of Ethiopian legend "Arwe", though it is unclear why.[250]
53	Tutimheb
ቱት ኤምሄብ	1770–1750 B.C.	3730–3750 A.M.	20 years	Tehuti-em-heb[125]
Thout-em-heb[62]
Tharbos[73]
E. A. Wallis Budge theorised that this king's name was drawn from "Tehuti-em-heb",[125] referring to the original Egyptian name for the god Thoth. This would appear to be the correct interpretation, as Louis J. Morié called this king "Thout-em-heb", which is closer to the name "Thoth".[62]
Louis J. Morié claimed this king was the father of Tharbis,[73] a Cushite princess who married Moses after he defeated the Aethiopians as head of the Egyptian army, according to a narrative by Josephus.[305]
Peter Truhart stated that this king was deposed by the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep I,[250] likely following Morié's narrative that this king was defeated by Moses, who was the head of the army of Amenhotep I.[306] However, the estimated reign dates of Amenhotep I (c. 1524–1503 B.C.) are far later than the reign dates of Tutimheb.
54	Her Hator I
ሔርሐቶር	1750–1730 B.C.	3750–3770 A.M.	20 years	Yotor[10]
At-Hor[64][250]
Jethre[250]
Hephaestus[66]
Ancient Greek god Hephaestus who was the father of Ethiopis according to Pliny the Elder.[61]
Louis J. Morié claimed that the previous king "Thout-em-heb" was replaced by Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I with one of the pharaoh's astronomers, "At-Hor", who is Jethro of the Bible.[64] This would mean that At-Hor/Jethro was the father of Zipporah, wife of Moses, the latter having lead the army of Amenhotep I against Thout-em-heb/Tutimheb according to Morié's narrative.[306] The author of the 1922 Ethiopian king list may have combined the two separate narratives of Hephaestus and Jethro into one king.
55	Etiyopus II
ኢትዮጲስ	1730–1700 B.C.	3770–3800 A.M.	30 years	Atew[68][250]
Ityopis[268]
Son of Vulcan (Roman counterpart of Hephaestus) according to Pliny the Elder.[61]
56	Senuka I

Snouka-Menkon[47][250]
Snouka-Menken[48]
Sanuka[268]
Aktisanes[47]
Louis J. Morié used "Snouka Menkon" as an alternate name for the Kushite king Aktisanes in his 1904 book Historie de l'Éthiopie.[47] Though he used the name twice, and claimed the second of these kings ruled Egypt after defeating Akhenaten.[48]
57	Bonu I
ቦኑ	1683–1675 B.C.	3817–3825 A.M.	8 years	Bennou[70]

The name of this king is based on Bennu, an Egyptian god.[70]

አሩአስ	1671 B.C.	3829 A.M.	7 months	Arwas[250]
Aru'aso[268]
Daughter of Mumazes according to Tafari.[308]
However, Louis J. Morié originally claimed that Aruas was a son of Mumazes.[74] Both Aleka Taye and Peter Truhart retained this identification on their respective king lists.[10][250]
60	Amen Asro I
አሚን አስሮ	1671–1641 B.C.	3829–3859 A.M.	30 years	Amanislo[125]
Asru-meri-Amen[250]
Ra-anh-ne-wer-het[74][250]
Amen Asero
Amen Asaro[268]
E. A. Wallis Budge believed this king to be identifiable with Amanislo, a Nubian king of Kush who ruled from c. 260 to 250 BC and whose name is inscribed on a granite lion statue currently held in the British Museum.[125][309] Louis J. Morié however identified Amanislo with the second king named "Amen Asro" (no. 116).[310]
Peter Truhart dated this king's reign to before 1400 B.C. and stated he invaded Egypt.[250] This was likely inspired by Louis J. Morié's original narrative that Amen Asro I had ruled Egypt briefly for 2 years.[75]
61	Ori II

ጲኦሪ	1611–1596 B.C.	3889–3904 A.M.	15 years	Paser I[78]
Poeri[78]
Perahu[250]
Peter Truhart believed this king is identifiable with Perahu, the only known king of Punt, who was a contemporary of Pharaoh Hatshepsut (r. 1479–1458 B.C.).[250]
However, Louis J. Morié's original narrative in Historie de l'Ethiopie, which inspired a significant portion of the 1922 Ethiopian king list, misidentified Paser I, Viceroy of Kush, as a reigning king of Aethiopia.[78] Paser was the father of Amenemopet, who is named as the next king on this list, "Amen Emhat I". Paser was also in power during the reigns of Ay and Horemheb (c. 1323–1292 B.C.) and thus was alive over two and a half centuries after the dates on this king list.
63	Amen Emhat I
አሜን ኤምሐት	1596–1556 B.C.	3904–3944 A.M.	40 years	Amenemopet[78]
Aminswamhat Behas[10]
Louis J. Morié misidentified the Viceroys of Kush named Paser I and Amenemopet as reigning kings of Aethiopia (i.e. Kush).[78] As such, the king "Amen Emhat I" is to be equated with Amenemopet, who followed his father Paser I/"Piori II" to power. Morié himself called Amenemopet by the name "Amen-em-hat".[78] Amenemopet was Viceroy of Kush during the reign of Seti I (c. 1290–1279 B.C.)
Peter Truhart believed this king was a contemporary of Ramesses II of Egypt, likely based on Morié's narrative.[250]
The name "Amenemhat" was used by several pharaohs who ruled Egypt between 1991 and 1765 BC, all much earlier than this legendary king. The kings named Amenemhat of the Twelfth Dynasty did rule over Nubia, but are not known to have ruled as far south as modern day Ethiopia.
64	Tsawi

Aktisanes
Oktisanisa[10]
Legendary king of Aethiopia who, according to Diodorus, defeated the Egyptian Pharaoh Ahmose II.[69]
"Actisanes" was possibly based on the historical Kushite king Aktisanes who ruled Nubia in the early third century B.C.
66	Mandes
ማንዲስ	1531–1514 B.C.	3969–3986 A.M.	17 years	Minos
Menden
Marron
Possibly a legendary king of Egypt mentioned by Diodorus, known as Menden or Marron, who built the famous Labyrinth and succeeded Actisanes.[69] This king is better known as the legendary king of Crete, Minos, who appears in Greek mythology.
67	Protawos
ጵሮቶውስ	1514–1481 B.C.	3986–4019 A.M.	33 years	Pretowes Seshul[10]

An Egyptian king from Greek mythology who is mentioned the writings of Herodotus, Euripides and Homer.
The existence of this king is not supported by archeology and he does not appear on any Egyptian king lists.
68	Amoy I

Khonsu?
This king's name means "Konsi the Indian".[10][268]
According to Louis J. Morié's narrative, this king arrived in Aethiopia as part of a Hindu colony and was a son of the goddess Ganga.[80] Peter Truhart seemingly followed this narrative and claimed Konsi Hendawi originated from a region along the Ganges river.[250]
The name "Konsi" may be based on the name of the Egyptian god Khonsu.

Louis J. Morié identified this king as several different legendary characters from Greek mythology, specifically Phoenix (son of the king of Tyre), Belus (King of Egypt), Aleus (King of Arcadia), Polydorus (King of Thebes) and Argus (King of Argos).[82] Both Belus and Phoenix have been identified in different sources as the father of Cepheus, the next ruler on this king list.[312][313] This may explain why Morié chose to combine these mythical figures into one individual, as the name "Belus" is similar to "Bennu", an Egyptian god that may have inspired the Greek legends of the Phoenix.

Peter Truhart stated this king invaded Egypt during the reign of pharaoh Amenmesse,[250] likely following Louis J. Morié's narrative that this king ruled Egypt during the first three years of his reign after defeating Amenmesse,[86] although Amenmesse actually reigned more than two centuries after the dates of Senuka II on this king list.

Angabos[223][268]
Agabo[151]
Angad[151]
Za on Zia-Bisi-Angaba[151]
King who killed a mythical serpent called Arwe or Wainaba in native Ethiopian tradition.[223]
Some sources claim that this ruler was the founder of a new dynasty in 1370 B.C.[251]
Some variations of the Arwe myth claim that Angabo was of non-royal origin and was made king as reward for slaying Arwe.[304] This version of the legend states that Angabo was a stranger who saved Makeda (the future Queen of Sheba) from being sacrified to Arwe and that her father was chief minister to king "Za Sebado".[314]
Some Ethiopian sources place Arwe at the beginning of Ethiopian history,[315] though this is obviously not the case with Tafari's list.
Some traditions claim that Angabo was king for 200 years.[316]
According to Aleka Taye, Angabo was the son of "Adhana", though it is unclear what their relation, if any, is to this dynastic line.[10]
According to some Ethiopian traditions, Angabo was the father of Makeda.[317]

Mistakenly numbered "Akate (Za Sagado) IV" by Tafari.[279] This is likely due to Louis J. Morié's original narrative which named a king called "Nekhti IV" as the successor of "Her Hator III".[91]
Sagado is the name of a mountain in the Amhara region.[324]
Some Ethiopian traditions claim this king reigned for 50 years.[284][283]
The name "Akate" could be based on "Nycteus", as following Louis J. Morié's narrative and line succession for the kings of Aethiopia,[323] while "Za Sagado" is likely based on "Sebado", the name of one of the successors of Angabo in native Ethiopian tradition.[283]

ቲቶን ሶትዮ	1256–1246 B.C.	4244–4254 A.M.	10 years	Tetouni[325]

Tithon[325]
Tetuni[126]
Tinton Sotio[10][322]
Tithonus
Tithonus, prince of Troy and father of Memnon and Emathion in Greek mythology. Louis J. Morié claimed he attempted to conquer Aethiopia but was taken prisoner by "Nekhti IV" (identifiable with "Akate IV" on this list).[326] However, the daughter of the Aethiopian king wished to marry him, so he was freed and later became king.[326]
Morié also claimed that this king ruled parts of Upper Egypt during the reign of pharaoh Amenmesse.[326] However, Amenmesse actually reigned over half a century after the dates on this king list.
While Truhart identified the previous king Akate as the father of Memnon,[126] the name of Memnon's father was Tithonus which has a much stronger similarity with the name of Titon Satiyo.

Her-Mentou[327]
Hermathion[327]
Se-Khons[327]
Gigon[327]
Emathion, a king of Aethiopia in Greek mythology who was a son of Tithonus (no. 81) and brother of Memnon (no. 83).[55]
Mistakenly numbered "Hermantu I" by Tafari.[279] This confusion is likely to have been caused by Louis J. Morié's narrative, which named two sons of Tithonus named "Hermantu", though it was the second who ruled Aethiopia.[94]
An illegitimate son of Titon Satiyo according to Louis J. Morié's narrative.[327] Peter Truhart repeated this narrative in his book Regents of Nations.[126]
Ethiopian historian Fisseha Yaze Kassa stated that this king reigned for only 1 month.[328] One version of Heruy Wolde Selassie's king list also lists a 1-month reign for this king while another lists 5 months.[322] Manfred Kropp theorized that the confusion could be a transcibal error resulting from the similarity of the Ethiopian numbers for 1 and 5.[299]
83	Amen Emhat II
አሜን ኤምሐት	1246–1241 B.C.	4254–4259 A.M.	5 years	Memnon[329][126]
Amenemhat-Meiamoun[329]
Memno[329]
Enpasos[329]
Meiamun Amenemhat[126]
The Greek mythical figure Memnon, who was king of Aethiopia and fought in the Trojan war. He was a son of Tithonus (no. 81 on this king list) and brother of Emathion (no. 82).
In Louis J. Morié's narrative, this king was confusingly not the same "Memnon" that took part in the Trojan war.[94] However, Peter Truhart identified this king with Memnon in his book Regents of Nations.[126] The dating used on Tafari's list makes an identification with the Memnon of the Trojan war plausible.
Historian Martin Bernal, in his controversial work Black Athena, argued that it was possible for the name "Memnon" to have originated from the Egyptian name "Amenemhat".[330]
Louis J. Morié claimed that this king was the inventor of the Meroitic script,[97] but in reality this script dates to the 2nd century BC at the earliest.
84	Konsab
ኮንሳብ	1241–1236 B.C.	4259–4264 A.M.	5 years	Khons-Ab[126]
Kus-awil-dendan[126]
Son of Akate Za Sagado.[126]
Name means "Heart of Khons".[331]
85	Sannib
ሳኒብ	1236–1231 B.C.	4264–4269 A.M.	5 years	Konseb[10]
Khons-Ab[126]
This king's name could be an error. Aleka Taye called this king "Konseb II" rather than Sannib and this may explain why Tafari called this king "Sannib II" on his king list despite no prior king named Sannib appearing on this king list. This also may be why he refers to the prior king as "Konsab I" despite no further kings of name appearing on this list. It is possible that "Sannib" may be a mistakenly transcribed name combining the prior king "Konsab" with the next king "Sanuka".
86	Sanuka III
ሰኑካ	1231–1226 B.C.	4269–4274 A.M.	5 years	Snouka-Menken[99]
Snuka-Menken[126]
Snouka (Aktisanes)
Peter Truhart identified this king with Aktisanes, even though he is already being named earlier in this king list.[126] This is likely based on Louis J. Morié's narrative in his book Historie de l'Éthiopie, in which he used the name "Aktisanes" as an alternate name for this king.[47]
87	Angabo II

Amen-As-Tat[100]
Monostatos[100][126]
Egyptian High Priest of Amun Amenhotep.[332]
According to Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria, this king was the father of Herihor.[332] However, there is no archaeological evidence to prove this.
Unlike the later High Priests of Amun on this list, Amenhotep did not style himself as Pharaoh of Upper Egypt.
Louis J. Morié's narrative in Historie de l'Éthiopie did not identify Amen Astate with the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep and instead claimed there was a gap of 130 years between this king and "Her-Hor".[100]
89	Herhor
ሔርሆር	1156–1140 B.C.	4344–4360 A.M.	16 years	Herihor[333]
Arhor[10]
Her-Hor Meiamoun Se-Amen[333]
Nouter-hon-tep-en-Amen[333]
Egyptian High Priest of Amun Herihor.[125]
Herihor was the de facto ruler of Upper Egypt during the time of the Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt. Mainstream Egyptologists however place his reign much later compared to this king list (c. 1080–1074 B.C.). He is also now believed to have succeeded Piankh rather than preceded him.
Herihor and his successors maintained rule of Upper Egypt for over 130 years, though there is no evidence their rule extended to the area of modern-day Ethiopia.
Herihor was also Viceroy of Kush during the reign of Ramesses XI.
Peter Truhart omitted this king from his king list.[126]
90	Wiyankihi I
ፒያንኪያ	1140–1131 B.C.	4360–4369 A.M.	9 years	Piankh[334]
Piyankihi
Piyankiya[322]
Pianki Henquqay[10]
Nouter-hon-tep-en-Amen[334]
Egyptian High Priest of Amun Piankh, who is believed by Egyptologists to have ruled Upper Egypt from c. 1074 to c. 1070 B.C., over half a century after the dates on this list.
Piankh was also Viceroy of Kush and led a campaign into Nubia.
Peter Truhart omitted this king from his king list.[126]
91	Pinotsem I
ፕኖትሲም	1131–1114 B.C.	4369–4386 A.M.	17 years	Pinedjem[335]
Tenot Sem[10]
Pinotsem Meiamoun[335]
Ra-men-khoper Mei-Is-Sotep-en-Amen[335]
Egyptian High Priest of Amun Pinedjem I,[125] who is believed by Egyptologists to have ruled Upper Egypt from c. 1070 to c. 1032 B.C.
Son of Piankh.
Peter Truhart omitted this king from his king list.[126]
92	Pinotsem II
ፕኖትሲም	1114–1073 B.C.	4386–4427 A.M.	41 years	Tenot Sem[10]
Pinedjem
Pinotsem Meiamoun[335]
Ra-khoper-ka Sotep-en-Amen[335]
Although there was a second High Priest of Amun named Pinedjem, his line of succession fits more closely with the position of Pinotsem III below.
Manfred Kropp noted that the existence of a third High Priest of Amun named Pinedjem was an error in late 19th-century Egyptology, which suggests that the writer of Tafari's king list had used European sources for compiling the list.[25]
Peter Truhart omitted this king from his king list.[126]
Louis J. Morié's narrative in Historie de l'Éthiopie claimed this king was a son of Pinotsem I.[102]
93	Massaherta
ማሳሔርታ	1073–1057 B.C.	4427–4443 A.M.	16 years	Masaharta[336]
Mashirtar Tuklay[10]
Nouter-hon-tep-en-Amen[336]
Egyptian High Priest of Amun Masaharta,[125] who is believed by Egyptologists to have succeeded Pinedjem I and to have ruled Upper Egypt from c. 1054 to c. 1045 B.C.
Son of Pinedjem I/Pinotsem I.
Louis J. Morié's narrative in Historie de l'Éthiopie claimed this king was a son of Pinotsem II.[102]
