Criminal investi<mark>g</mark>ations
Days after the attack, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said he was specifically lookin<mark>g</mark> at whether to char<mark>g</mark>e Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and Mo Brooks with incitin<mark>g</mark> the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol Buildin<mark>g</mark>, and indicated that he mi<mark>g</mark>ht consider char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> Donald Trump when he has left office.[16] Calls for Trump to be prosecuted for incitin<mark>g</mark> the crowd to storm the Capitol Buildin<mark>g</mark> also were made in the aftermath of the event.[17] D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said, "We saw an unprecedented attack on our American democracy incited by the United States president. He must be held accountable. His constant and divisive rhetoric led to the abhorrent actions we saw today."[18] Le<mark>g</mark>al experts have stated that char<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> Trump with incitement would be difficult under Brandenbur<mark>g</mark> v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court rulin<mark>g</mark> which established that for speech to be considered criminally incitin<mark>g</mark>, it must have been intended to incite "imminent lawless action" and "likely to incite or produce such action".[19]

In biolo<mark>g</mark>ical nomenclature, or<mark>g</mark>anisms often receive scientific names that honor a person. A taxon (e.<mark>g</mark>. species or <mark>g</mark>enus; plural: taxa) named in honor of another entity is an eponymous taxon, and names specifically honorin<mark>g</mark> a person or persons are known as patronyms. Scientific names are <mark>g</mark>enerally formally published in peer-reviewed journal articles or lar<mark>g</mark>er mono<mark>g</mark>raphs alon<mark>g</mark> with descriptions of the named taxa and ways to distin<mark>g</mark>uish them from other taxa. Followin<mark>g</mark> rules of Latin <mark>g</mark>rammar, species or subspecies names derived from a man's name often end in -i or -ii if named for an individual, and -orum if named for a <mark>g</mark>roup of men or mixed-sex <mark>g</mark>roup, such as a family. Similarly, those named for a woman often end in -ae, or -arum for two or more women.

This list is part of the List of or<mark>g</mark>anisms named after famous people, and includes or<mark>g</mark>anisms named after famous individuals born between 1 January 1900 and 31 December 1949. It also includes ensembles (includin<mark>g</mark> bands and comedy troupes) in which at least one member was born within those dates; but excludes companies, institutions, ethnic <mark>g</mark>roups or nationalities, and populated places. It does not include or<mark>g</mark>anisms named for fictional entities, for biolo<mark>g</mark>ists, paleontolo<mark>g</mark>ists or other natural scientists,[note 1] nor for associates or family members of researchers who are not otherwise notable; exceptions are made, however, for natural scientists who are much more famous for other aspects of their lives, such as, for example, Japanese emperors Hirohito and Akihito.

Sir David Attenborou<mark>g</mark>h was formerly included in this section of the list as one of these exceptions, since despite his formal trainin<mark>g</mark> as a natural scientist, he is more widely known to the public as a documentary filmmaker. However, due to the hi<mark>g</mark>h number of taxa named after him (over 50 as of 2022), he has been removed; his patronyms can be found in the List of thin<mark>g</mark>s named after David Attenborou<mark>g</mark>h and his works.

The 2020–21 season was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as lots of domestic and European <mark>g</mark>ames were played behind closed doors.

The 2021–22 season, which was documented in the Amazon Prime Video series All or Nothin<mark>g</mark>: Arsenal,[15][16] was a rollercoaster season for the Gunners.[17][18] With their three consecutive defeats to open the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue campai<mark>g</mark>n, the club dropped to 20th, sittin<mark>g</mark> at the bottom of the table, which was their worst start to a season for 67 years.[19][20] Since then, a new look Arsenal started to emer<mark>g</mark>e, with several academy <mark>g</mark>raduates and new si<mark>g</mark>nin<mark>g</mark>s makin<mark>g</mark> a major impact.[21] In fact, the Gunners were the youn<mark>g</mark>est team in the 2021–22 Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue with an avera<mark>g</mark>e startin<mark>g</mark> a<mark>g</mark>e of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year youn<mark>g</mark>er than the next team.[22][23] Arteta's Arsenal rebuild on and off the pitch be<mark>g</mark>an to take shape in this season,[24][25] with the Gunners movin<mark>g</mark> into the top four for several times between December 2021 and May 2022.

Ahead of the first international break of the season, the Gunners faced 8th-placed Brentford away at Brentford Community Stadium on 18 September.[151] Before kick-off, there was a minute's silence in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, followed by a rendition of the national anthem "God Save the Kin<mark>g</mark>".[152][153] In the 17th minute, Saliba opened the scorin<mark>g</mark> with a header from Saka's corner. Eleven minutes later, Gabriel Jesus doubled Arsenal's advanta<mark>g</mark>e with another header from Xhaka's chip. In the 49th minute, Vieira collected a Saka pass in space outside the Brentford box and unleashed a strike that crashed in off the post, markin<mark>g</mark> his first Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue start, and sealin<mark>g</mark> a 3–0 win.[154] Nketiah made his 100th appearance for the team as a substitute in the 78th minute.[152] As a schoolboy midfielder at the a<mark>g</mark>e of 15 years and 181 days, Ethan Nwaneri came off the bench to replace Vieira in second-half stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time.

On 1 October, followin<mark>g</mark> the international break, it was North London derby day in the lea<mark>g</mark>ue as the club played at home to 3rd-placed Tottenham.[168] Partey opened the scorin<mark>g</mark> in the 20th minute with a ri<mark>g</mark>ht-footed curled shot from 25 yards assisted by Ben White.

The <mark>g</mark>ame saw <mark>g</mark>oalkeeper Ramsdale produce a man of the match display as the Gunners won 1–0.[185] In a unique start to the <mark>g</mark>ame, a power cut outside the stadium after 60 seconds forced a 40-minute suspension,[186] because referee Chris Kavana<mark>g</mark>h found that he lost communication with VAR, which would play a crucial role when the match eventually resumed.[187] Once they <mark>g</mark>ot <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> a<mark>g</mark>ain, Saka scored the winnin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>oal from a ti<mark>g</mark>ht an<mark>g</mark>le in the 35th minute, assisted by Øde<mark>g</mark>aard.[188] After a VAR check, Leeds were awarded a penalty in the 62nd minute when Saliba was adjud<mark>g</mark>ed to have handled the ball inside the box, but striker Patrick Bamford dra<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ed his effort wide of Ramsdale's left-hand post.[186][187][188] In stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time, referee Kavana<mark>g</mark>h sent off defender Gabriel Ma<mark>g</mark>alhães for kickin<mark>g</mark> out at Bamford and awarded the hosts a second penalty after discussin<mark>g</mark> with his assistant, but both decisions were overturned after Kavana<mark>g</mark>h was su<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ested by VAR to review the incident on the pitchside monitor.[186][187][188] This was the club's best start to a top-fli<mark>g</mark>ht campai<mark>g</mark>n as the Gunners had won nine of their first ten lea<mark>g</mark>ue <mark>g</mark>ames for the first time ever.[188] The result also moved Arsenal four points clear at the top of the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue.[186][187]

At 21 years and 177 days, he became the sixth-youn<mark>g</mark>est player to reach the milestone in the competition,[414][415] and the youn<mark>g</mark>est Arsenal player since Cesc Fàbre<mark>g</mark>as achieved it in April 2008.[416][417] Saka also became the first Arsenal player – the ei<mark>g</mark>hth player in Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue history – to score 10 or more <mark>g</mark>oals in multiple Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue seasons before turnin<mark>g</mark> 22.[417] In first-half stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time, Everton's Idrissa Gueye was cau<mark>g</mark>ht dawdlin<mark>g</mark> on the ball, Saka nicked it off his toe and immediately played in Martinelli who raced throu<mark>g</mark>h and slotted the ball past Pickford.[418] The <mark>g</mark>oal was initially ruled out for offside by the linesman's fla<mark>g</mark>, but the decision was overturned after a VAR check.[414][418] This meant that both Saka and Martinelli netted their 10th Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue <mark>g</mark>oals of the season, and Arsenal became the first team to have two players reach double fi<mark>g</mark>ures for <mark>g</mark>oals this campai<mark>g</mark>n.[414][417] The Gunners added a third on 71 minutes when Øde<mark>g</mark>aard tucked home a Trossard cutback.[418] In the 80th minute, Martinelli scored his second <mark>g</mark>oal of the ni<mark>g</mark>ht by tappin<mark>g</mark> Nketiah's cross in from close ran<mark>g</mark>e.[418] Ramsdale made a double save in second-half stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time, helpin<mark>g</mark> the hosts win 4–0.[414] This was Arsenal's 100th lea<mark>g</mark>ue victory a<mark>g</mark>ainst Everton, makin<mark>g</mark> the Gunners the first team in En<mark>g</mark>lish lea<mark>g</mark>ue history to re<mark>g</mark>ister 100 wins a<mark>g</mark>ainst a specific opponent.[414][415] The result moved them five points clear at the top of the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue, and ensured it was the third time the club had picked up at least 60 points from the first 25 <mark>g</mark>ames in a sin<mark>g</mark>le Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue campai<mark>g</mark>n, after 2003–04 and 2007–08.[419][420]

Three days later, Arteta's side played at home a<mark>g</mark>ainst 19th-placed Bournemouth,[421] a match that saw the Gunners fall behind after just nine seconds and come back from two <mark>g</mark>oals down with half an hour left to beat the Cherries 3–2 with a stunnin<mark>g</mark> 97th-minute winner from substitute Nelson.[422][423][424] Vieira made his second Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue start for the club after replacin<mark>g</mark> Xhaka;[423] and this was the first time since January 1986 that Arsenal named a startin<mark>g</mark> line-up without a sin<mark>g</mark>le player to have made a competitive appearance under Wen<mark>g</mark>er, who was in char<mark>g</mark>e of the Gunners from 1996 to 2018.[425][426] Bournemouth took a surprise lead after just 9.11 seconds throu<mark>g</mark>h Philip Billin<mark>g</mark> from a preconceived kick-off routine.[423][427] It was the second-quickest <mark>g</mark>oal scored in the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue era.[422] In the 20th minute, Ramsdale made a vital save to deny Dan<mark>g</mark>o Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.[422] Two minutes later, Trossard was forced off with an injury and was replaced by academy <mark>g</mark>raduate Smith Rowe.[428] This meant that Arsenal's first three centre-forwards – Gabriel Jesus, Nketiah and Trossard – were all injured at the moment, and Martinelli had to play up top, in a role he had never been in this season.[423] On 57 minutes, the hosts fell further behind to Marcos Senesi's header from a corner.[422] In the 62nd minute, A Saka corner was cleared to Smith Rowe, and he headed back into the six-yard box for Partey to tap home at the back post.[423] On 69 minutes, academy <mark>g</mark>raduate Nelson made his third Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue appearance of the season as he came off the bench to replace Smith Rowe.[427][429] Just a minute later, Nelson sent in a curlin<mark>g</mark> cross for defender White, who drove it <mark>g</mark>oalwards and over the line before Bournemouth keeper Neto pushed it away, with the <mark>g</mark>oal-line technolo<mark>g</mark>y confirmin<mark>g</mark> the ball had completely crossed the line.[422] It was White's first Arsenal <mark>g</mark>oal since he joined the club in 2021 and his first Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue <mark>g</mark>oal from 94 <mark>g</mark>ames.[428] With referee Chris Kavana<mark>g</mark>h set to blow the final whistle in the 7th minute of stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time, an Øde<mark>g</mark>aard corner was cleared as far as Nelson, who chested it down and smashed a left-footed shot throu<mark>g</mark>h a crowd of bodies and past visitin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>oalkeeper.[422][423][424] The <mark>g</mark>oal sparked bedlam on the pitch and the Arsenal bench, and sent Emirates Stadium into ecstasy.[430][429][428] Nelson's last-<mark>g</mark>asp stunner (96:57) was the Gunners' second-latest 90th-minute winner on record in the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue (since 2006–07), after Alexis Sánchez's penalty a<mark>g</mark>ainst Burnley in January 2017 (97:14).[423] Arteta's side had netted three 90th-minute winners in the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue this campai<mark>g</mark>n, the joint-most 90th-minute winners Arsenal had scored in a sin<mark>g</mark>le season in the competition.[428] This was the first time in Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue history that a team scored a 90th-minute winnin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>oal after havin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>one behind in the first minute since Au<mark>g</mark>ust 2007.[431] It was also the first time the Gunners had won a Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue <mark>g</mark>ame in which they trailed by two or more <mark>g</mark>oals since February 2012.[423]

The <mark>g</mark>oal was initially disallowed for offside, but the decision was overturned followin<mark>g</mark> a VAR review.[496] Nine minutes after the restart, De Bruyne latched onto a loose pass by Øde<mark>g</mark>aard and found Haaland, who fed it back to the Bel<mark>g</mark>ian for his second of the ni<mark>g</mark>ht.[499] The Gunners pulled one back in the 86th minute when Trossard received the ball from Jor<mark>g</mark>inho and played a pass to Holdin<mark>g</mark>, who lashed an effort past City <mark>g</mark>oalkeeper Ederson.[497] Haaland netted in second-half stoppa<mark>g</mark>e time, sealin<mark>g</mark> a 4–1 win for the hosts, and endin<mark>g</mark> Arsenal's ten-<mark>g</mark>ame unbeaten run in the Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue.[499] The defeat extended the Gunners' lon<mark>g</mark>est losin<mark>g</mark> run a<mark>g</mark>ainst an opponent in their lea<mark>g</mark>ue history, as Arsenal had lost their last 12 Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue <mark>g</mark>ames a<mark>g</mark>ainst City, losin<mark>g</mark> by an a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>re<mark>g</mark>ate score of 5–33.[497] The Gunners were the first side to concede at least two <mark>g</mark>oals in four consecutive top-fli<mark>g</mark>ht <mark>g</mark>ames in which they started the day top since Manchester United in December 1966, and they were also the first side to <mark>g</mark>o four strai<mark>g</mark>ht Premier Lea<mark>g</mark>ue matches winless when startin<mark>g</mark> the day top since themselves in March 2008.[497][499][500] After the match, their lead at the top of the lea<mark>g</mark>ue was cut to two points over Guardiola's side who had two <mark>g</mark>ames in hand and a superior <mark>g</mark>oal difference.[496] Despite the loss, Arteta's side mathematically qualified for next season's UEFA Champions Lea<mark>g</mark>ue after six-year absence.[497]

1	Fox affiliate WDKY/Danville–Lexin<mark>g</mark>ton, Kentucky launches an in-house news department, endin<mark>g</mark> a news outsourcin<mark>g</mark> a<mark>g</mark>reement—one of the lon<mark>g</mark>est such a<mark>g</mark>reements in American television history—that it had maintained with Gray-owned CBS affiliate WKYT (which debuted a separate prime time newscast for its CW-affiliated DT2 subchannel on that ni<mark>g</mark>ht) since its 10:00 p.m. newscast premiered in January 1995; WDKY employed its own anchors to present the WKYT-produced broadcasts, all of whom were retained for the new operation (accompanied by reporters, sportscasters and meteorolo<mark>g</mark>ists hired for the in-house productions) as were some feature se<mark>g</mark>ments that ori<mark>g</mark>inated on the outsourced newscasts. The switch to an in-house production follows the physical expansion and equipment up<mark>g</mark>rade of WDKY's studios by Nexstar Media Group (which acquired the station in September 2020 throu<mark>g</mark>h a settlement over previous owner Sinclair's failed acquisition of Tribune Media, of which Nexstar acquired most assets in 2019). An expanded weekday mornin<mark>g</mark> newscast (increased to four hours from its previous one-hour runtime as a WKYT production) and a new half-hour early evenin<mark>g</mark> newscast subsequently debuted on January 3.	[1]
3	The Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball-owned MLB Network declines to renew the contract of insider Ken Rosenthal; it is believed to be the result of Rosenthal's criticisms of lea<mark>g</mark>ue commissioner Rob Manfred's handlin<mark>g</mark> of the pandemic-altered 2020 season. Rosenthal retains positions as MLB reporter for Fox Sports and writer for The Athletic (where he penned his critiques of Manfred).	[2]
Art Rascon retires from broadcastin<mark>g</mark> after 36 years, 23 of which were with KTRK-TV/Houston (servin<mark>g</mark> as a midday and 5:00 p.m. anchor and field reporter). On his final day at the ABC O&O, Rascon co-anchors its 11:00 a.m. newscast alon<mark>g</mark>side son Jacob (previously with rival NBC affiliate KPRC), who made his KTRK debut as an anchor/reporter on that date.

4–6	Two late-ni<mark>g</mark>ht talk shows pause production after their hosts test positive for COVID-19: NBC's Late Ni<mark>g</mark>ht cancels its scheduled tapin<mark>g</mark>s throu<mark>g</mark>h January 6 in the wake of host Seth Meyers' positive test one day after their January 3 return from a holiday production hiatus (Meyers' <mark>g</mark>uests for that show joined in remotely). On the 6th, CBS' Late Late Show also <mark>g</mark>oes dark throu<mark>g</mark>h January 18 due to James Corden's own positive test. Meyers' and Corden's dia<mark>g</mark>noses come after Jimmy Fallon, whose The Toni<mark>g</mark>ht Show tapes in the same buildin<mark>g</mark> as Late Ni<mark>g</mark>ht, revealed he tested COVID-positive after his show's December 17 tapin<mark>g</mark>, just before Toni<mark>g</mark>ht's own holiday hiatus; Fallon (who was fully vaccinated, as are Meyers and Corden) fully recovered before production resumed on January 3, meanin<mark>g</mark> Toni<mark>g</mark>ht did not have to face postponements. However, Fallon was revealed to have been intended to make a cameo on Saturday Ni<mark>g</mark>ht Live's December 18 episode, and thus may have contributed to the episode's emer<mark>g</mark>ency reformattin<mark>g</mark>. Late Ni<mark>g</mark>ht would return with Meyers hostin<mark>g</mark> remotely for the week of January 10–13 with most crew members workin<mark>g</mark> from home or in-studio, before returnin<mark>g</mark> to the studio.

5	Thirteen current and former female staffers file a <mark>g</mark>ender discrimination lawsuit a<mark>g</mark>ainst the Black News Channel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, claimin<mark>g</mark> that mana<mark>g</mark>ement paid female employees si<mark>g</mark>nificantly less than male staffers, harbored a miso<mark>g</mark>ynistic work culture that forced them to conform to behavioral <mark>g</mark>ender stereotypes, and retaliated a<mark>g</mark>ainst those who complained about the pay disparities and personal treatment. Two of the plaintiffs in the amended lawsuit had filed a prior complaint a<mark>g</mark>ainst BNC in Au<mark>g</mark>ust 2021.	[12]
After Kevin Porter Jr. hits a <mark>g</mark>ame-winnin<mark>g</mark> three-pointer, Washin<mark>g</mark>ton Wizards broadcaster Glenn Consor remarks on the NBC Sports Washin<mark>g</mark>ton broadcast that the Houston Rockets star, "like his dad, pulled the tri<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>er at the ri<mark>g</mark>ht time." But Consor's comment draws the ire on social media, from LeBron James and others, as Porter's father went to prison after pleadin<mark>g</mark> <mark>g</mark>uilty in the 1993 shootin<mark>g</mark> death of a 14-year-old <mark>g</mark>irl. In apolo<mark>g</mark>izin<mark>g</mark> for the incident, Consor claimed he thou<mark>g</mark>ht Kevin Porter Jr. was related to former Washin<mark>g</mark>ton player Kevin Porter.	[13]
7	The Ma<mark>g</mark>nolia Network, which replaced DIY Network three days before, pulls the home renovation series Home Work from their schedule and Discovery+ presence (where it had streamed since the summer of 2021), followin<mark>g</mark> alle<mark>g</mark>ations from three subject families of not meetin<mark>g</mark> timelines, hi<mark>g</mark>h additional costs, and lack of communication by the show's hosts, Andy and Candis Meredith. The show would be returned to the lineups on January 13.	[14][15]
By earnin<mark>g</mark> $42,220 in her 28th victory, Amy Schneider becomes the first female contestant and fourth overall to win over $1 million in re<mark>g</mark>ular <mark>g</mark>ameplay on Jeopardy!. Schneider would <mark>g</mark>o on to surpass Matt Amodio for the second-most consecutive wins in the <mark>g</mark>ame show's history with her 39th victory on January 24. Her win streak ended at 40 two days later. (Ken Jennin<mark>g</mark>s, who has presided over Schneider's win streak as part-time interim host, holds the most consecutive wins with 74 durin<mark>g</mark> his streak as Jeopardy! champion in 2004.)

12	Richard Bur<mark>g</mark>i confirms in an Insta<mark>g</mark>ram post that he was fired from The Youn<mark>g</mark> and the Restless for an inadvertent breach of distributor Sony Pictures Television's COVID-19 protocols, disclosin<mark>g</mark> that he isolated for five days after testin<mark>g</mark> COVID-positive durin<mark>g</mark> the CBS soap opera's holiday production hiatus in December—in accordance with prior CDC <mark>g</mark>uidelines, revised that month to a five-day isolation period—rather than the SPT requirement for personnel to isolate for ten days which had not been revised. He then returned to the set five days early, testin<mark>g</mark> ne<mark>g</mark>ative twice. In contrast to other soap actors that were fired for COVID policy violations in 2021, some of whom publicly criticized their studios and networks, Bur<mark>g</mark>i expressed sincere re<mark>g</mark>ret for his jud<mark>g</mark>ement. Robert Newman, known for playin<mark>g</mark> Josh Lewis on Guidin<mark>g</mark> Li<mark>g</mark>ht off-and-on from 1981 until its 2009 conclusion, assumed the role of Ashland Locke (which Bur<mark>g</mark>i had played since the character debuted in March 2021) on the February 9 episode, and portrayed the character on-screen until July 25.

14	DirecTV announces it would cease carria<mark>g</mark>e of One America News Network and AWE when the namesake satellite provider and sister service U-verse TV’s contract with parent company Herrin<mark>g</mark> Networks expires on April 4. The radicalist-leanin<mark>g</mark>, conservative OAN has received criticism for pushin<mark>g</mark> conspiracy theories (particularly involvin<mark>g</mark> COVID-19 vaccines and health restrictions, and debunked claims of electoral fraud durin<mark>g</mark> the 2020 presidential election and left-win<mark>g</mark> involvement in the January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol) while <mark>g</mark>ainin<mark>g</mark> support from former president Donald Trump. Wealth culture-focused AWE has had issues involvin<mark>g</mark> the low overall appeal of its pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> durin<mark>g</mark> economic recessions (most recently durin<mark>g</mark> the COVID-19 recession), and a<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ressive carria<mark>g</mark>e demands. Seven months later on July 21, Verizon Fios, which became the network's lar<mark>g</mark>est remainin<mark>g</mark> pay-TV carrier after the DirecTV removal, announced it would drop OAN on July 31, after failin<mark>g</mark> to a<mark>g</mark>ree on a new contract; this rele<mark>g</mark>ates OAN's distribution to smaller cable providers and OTA subchannels in select markets, ad-supported live-TV streamin<mark>g</mark> platforms (includin<mark>g</mark> Pluto TV and Xumo), and its proprietary subscription streamin<mark>g</mark> service.

Yor<mark>g</mark>ey—who conducted the report roadside in wet and icy conditions, and continued with the report afterward—was uninjured, but was taken to a local hospital for observation as a precaution. (The accident occurred durin<mark>g</mark> Yor<mark>g</mark>ey's last week at WSAZ; she became a reporter for ABC affiliate WTAE/Pittsbur<mark>g</mark>h on February 1.)	[28]
24	Deadline Hollywood reports ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) halted its proposed reformattin<mark>g</mark> of the <mark>g</mark>eneral entertainment Paramount Network as the primarily film-focused Paramount Movie Network, citin<mark>g</mark> the success of ori<mark>g</mark>inal drama series Yellowstone and COVID-related production delays of its planned telefilm output. First announced in September 2020, the reformatted channel was to offer ori<mark>g</mark>inal made-for-cable movies (includin<mark>g</mark> 52 new films per year), limited scripted series and miniseries (at least one per quarter), and films from the Paramount Pictures library. In preparation for the chan<mark>g</mark>e, several of the network's ori<mark>g</mark>inal unscripted pro<mark>g</mark>rams were either canceled outri<mark>g</mark>ht or moved to its sister channels or to Paramount+ durin<mark>g</mark> late 2020 and 2021.

[30]

A chan<mark>g</mark>e to the schedule in the 2022 World Series between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies due to rain earlier in the week leads to Game 5 bein<mark>g</mark> played directly opposite Amazon Prime Video's broadcast of a Thursday Ni<mark>g</mark>ht Football <mark>g</mark>ame featurin<mark>g</mark> both cities' NFL teams (the Texans and Ea<mark>g</mark>les respectively). Estimates from Nielsen Media Research show the baseball <mark>g</mark>ame drew an avera<mark>g</mark>e of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football <mark>g</mark>ame, ori<mark>g</mark>inally scheduled to air on the Fox O&Os in both markets (KRIV and WTXF, respectively) per NFL rules, moved to other stations. The Astros would <mark>g</mark>o on to win their second World Series championship in franchise history two days later on November 5, defeatin<mark>g</mark> the Phillies, 4–1, in Game 6.	[260][261]

Discovery announces a deal with Amazon to resume sellin<mark>g</mark> HBO Max throu<mark>g</mark>h Prime Video Channels startin<mark>g</mark> that day; the add-on features ad-free access to the full HBO Max content library within the Prime Video app, alon<mark>g</mark> with live feeds of HBO's seven linear channels (which are not offered in the native HBO Max app). The a<mark>g</mark>reement allows Prime Video to sell WBD's planned Max–Discovery+ combination service (see Au<mark>g</mark>ust 4 entry) when it launches in 2023. Under a deal si<mark>g</mark>ned in November 2020 that brou<mark>g</mark>ht the HBO Max app to Fire tablets and Fire TV devices, Prime Video's ori<mark>g</mark>inal HBO add-on was removed in September 2021 as part of a direct-to-consumer strate<mark>g</mark>y by former parent WarnerMedia that saw it shift away from sellin<mark>g</mark> HBO Max throu<mark>g</mark>h third-party channel stores (resultin<mark>g</mark> in those operated by Apple TV and Roku also removin<mark>g</mark> their HBO add-ons) so it could control user data throu<mark>g</mark>h its dedicated app, a move estimated to have cost HBO Max around five million subscribers.

8	Disney+ launches an ad-supported plan that offers an avera<mark>g</mark>e of four minutes of commercials per hour before and durin<mark>g</mark> most titles, with prohibitions for political and alcohol advertisin<mark>g</mark>, any ads durin<mark>g</mark> preschool-tar<mark>g</mark>eted pro<mark>g</mark>rams, and ads within kids’ user profiles. The "Disney+ Basic" plan costs US$7.99/month, the previous rate of the ad-free version (now known as "Disney+ Premium"), which concurrently received a US$3 price increase (alon<mark>g</mark> with correspondin<mark>g</mark> increases for that plan's bundles with Hulu and ESPN+). However, as distribution deals do not yet cover the AVOD plan, users of the service's Roku and Windows apps could not subscribe to the "Disney+ Basic" plan and all bundles includin<mark>g</mark> it—amon<mark>g</mark> them, a standalone "duo" bundle with Hulu introduced with the ad-supported tier—at launch. The ad-supported plan will be rolled out to international markets durin<mark>g</mark> 2023.	[305][306]

ABC cancels its scheduled December 14 broadcast of A Very Backstreet Holiday, a Christmas variety special starrin<mark>g</mark> the musical <mark>g</mark>roup Backstreet Boys, after a woman filed a sexual battery lawsuit accusin<mark>g</mark> BSB member Nick Carter of rapin<mark>g</mark> her and infectin<mark>g</mark> her with HPV in a February 2001 incident, when the woman was 17 and Carter (who denies the alle<mark>g</mark>ations) was 21.

10–11	The 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards are held at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los An<mark>g</mark>eles; JoJo Siwa hosted the Creative Arts ceremony (held on the 10th) and Jack McBrayer hosted the main ceremony (held on the 11th). Heartstopper won four of Netflix’s 15 total awards (the most earned by a sin<mark>g</mark>le linear network or streamin<mark>g</mark> platform durin<mark>g</mark> the inau<mark>g</mark>ural ceremony), includin<mark>g</mark> "Outstandin<mark>g</mark> Youn<mark>g</mark> Teen Series," "Outstandin<mark>g</mark> Lead Performance in a Preschool, Children's or Youn<mark>g</mark> Teen Pro<mark>g</mark>ram" (for Kit Connor) and "Outstandin<mark>g</mark> Guest Performance in a Preschool, Children's or Youn<mark>g</mark> Teen Pro<mark>g</mark>ram" (for Olivia Colman); LeVar Burton received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work on PBS's Readin<mark>g</mark> Rainbow and readin<mark>g</mark> advocacy efforts for children. This ceremony was created in November 2021 to account for the heavily increased quantity and quality of children's and family pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark>, after all dayparts for children's pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> fell under NATAS jurisdiction with the previous Daytime Emmys ceremony.

13	Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Soccer announces a four-year deal with Fox Sports that will see Fox, FS1, and Fox Deportes simulcast 34 MLS-produced re<mark>g</mark>ular season broadcasts, ei<mark>g</mark>ht playoff contests, and the MLS Cup championship <mark>g</mark>ame each season be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> in 2023. Fox will also share simulcast privil<mark>g</mark>es on the Lea<mark>g</mark>ues Cup competition with Spanish lan<mark>g</mark>ua<mark>g</mark>e broadcaster TelevisaUnivision over the same four-year period. The deals assure that MLS will keep a presence on traditional television in the wake of its exclusive deal with Apple (see June 14 entry). It also brin<mark>g</mark>s to a close MLS' relationship with ESPN, which lasted from the lea<mark>g</mark>ue's first <mark>g</mark>ame in April 1996 throu<mark>g</mark>h the 2022 season.	[310]
PBS, in its first third-party carria<mark>g</mark>e deal with a free ad-supported streamin<mark>g</mark> television (FAST) service, reaches a multi-year a<mark>g</mark>reement with Allen Media Group to distribute live feeds of the non-commercial public broadcaster's member stations and state/sub-re<mark>g</mark>ional networks, and its national children's network PBS Kids 24/7 over Local Now. Participatin<mark>g</mark> PBS stations will be added to the news and entertainment service's live TV platform throu<mark>g</mark>h 2023. The deal expands upon a partnership between PBS and AMG that be<mark>g</mark>an on March 2, when PBS Di<mark>g</mark>ital Studios added its dedicated streamin<mark>g</mark> network to Local Now's channel lineup. (PBS be<mark>g</mark>an offerin<mark>g</mark> live streams of its stations for free via its dedicated website and mobile app in 2020.)	[311][312]

The suspension came hours after McGinest's arrest on char<mark>g</mark>es of committin<mark>g</mark> assault with a deadly weapon; he was released later that day on a $30,000 bond.	[313][314]
21	Jim Gardner anchors WPVI-TV/Philadelphia's Action News for the final time, retirin<mark>g</mark> from the ABC O&O after 46 years. Brian Taff replaced him as anchor of its 6:00 p.m. newscast the followin<mark>g</mark> day. Gardner joined WPVI as an assi<mark>g</mark>nment reporter in June 1976, and became solo anchor of the station's 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts in May 1977 (he stepped down from the latter broadcast on January 11, succeeded there by lon<mark>g</mark>time anchor/reporter Rick Williams).

FuboTV and Diamond Sports Group reach an a<mark>g</mark>reement to resume carria<mark>g</mark>e of Bally Sports’s 19 re<mark>g</mark>ional networks on the vMVPD's base tier, endin<mark>g</mark> a nearly two-year-lon<mark>g</mark> dispute that be<mark>g</mark>an in January 2020. (Hulu and YouTube TV removed the RSNs—then branded as Fox Sports Networks—ten months after they were dropped by Fubo, leavin<mark>g</mark> DirecTV Stream as its only streamin<mark>g</mark> distributor until the June 23 launch of the Bally Sports+ OTT service.) The deal comes amid uncertainty over Bally Sports's future, as Major Lea<mark>g</mark>ue Baseball, the NBA and the NHL reportedly rejected an offer to jointly acquire the RSNs to help Diamond avoid bankruptcy (Diamond would likely seek to terminate Bally Sports's broadcast contracts, the majority of which were losin<mark>g</mark> revenue, durin<mark>g</mark> bankruptcy proceedin<mark>g</mark>s) and majority owner Sinclair Broadcast Group disclosed in November that Diamond did not have enou<mark>g</mark>h financial resources to service its operations and $9 billion debt load beyond 2023 and had been <mark>g</mark>eneratin<mark>g</mark> cash flow at half of initial 2022 projections (with net losses of $1.2 billion and revenue of $684 million in Q3, respectively up 809% and down 10% from the year prior). Two days later, Fubo renewed a deal with Marquee Sports Network (which Sinclair co-owns with the Chica<mark>g</mark>o Cubs) that would offer its national feed to subscribers outside the Chica<mark>g</mark>o market.

22	The National Football Lea<mark>g</mark>ue and Goo<mark>g</mark>le announce that the lea<mark>g</mark>ue's NFL Sunday Ticket packa<mark>g</mark>e will move exclusively to Goo<mark>g</mark>le-owned YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels be<mark>g</mark>innin<mark>g</mark> with the 2023 season, makin<mark>g</mark> Sunday Ticket available for purchase as a standalone add-on for the first time. Reports indicate that Goo<mark>g</mark>le will pay approximately $2 billion in annual ri<mark>g</mark>hts fees under the initial seven-year a<mark>g</mark>reement, which also extends YouTube TV's existin<mark>g</mark> carria<mark>g</mark>e a<mark>g</mark>reements for NFL Network and NFL RedZone. The out-of-market sports packa<mark>g</mark>e, which carries all Sunday afternoon <mark>g</mark>ames not telecast on a viewer's local CBS and Fox stations, had been carried on DirecTV since its launch in 1994.

It is unclear if the service is intended as a replacement for Weather Channel Plus, a broader subscription streamin<mark>g</mark> service announced by AMG on June 30, 2021, and ori<mark>g</mark>inally announced for a Q4 2021 launch, that was to offer content from The Weather Channel (includin<mark>g</mark> supplemental di<mark>g</mark>ital-only content) and more than 50 streamin<mark>g</mark> news and entertainment channels (similar to those offered by Local Now), alon<mark>g</mark> with a likely mer<mark>g</mark>er of Entertainment Studios Networks's "SmartTV.com" Roku service (which offers streams and content from ESN's seven entertainment networks) that pre-dated AMG's purchase of The Weather Channel.

Antenna TV (secondary)	On January 20, Lilly Broadcastin<mark>g</mark>—as part of affiliation renewals involvin<mark>g</mark> sister stations WENY/Elmira, New York and WSEE/Erie, Pennsylvania—announced that WZMQ would take over as the Upper Peninsula's CBS affiliate effective the followin<mark>g</mark> day, replacin<mark>g</mark> Nexstar Media Group-owned WJMN-TV, which had carried the network's pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> since February 1992, a byproduct of CBS's purchase of the station and Green Bay sister WFRV (of which WJMN served as a semi-satellite from its October 1969 si<mark>g</mark>n-on until the CBS disaffiliation) from Midwest Television and Radio. WJMN affiliated with MyNetworkTV (previously on WZMQ) and added pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> from Nexstar-owned Antenna TV to fill vacated overni<mark>g</mark>ht/early mornin<mark>g</mark> and weekend slots, while retainin<mark>g</mark> most of its syndicated content and expandin<mark>g</mark> its twice-daily evenin<mark>g</mark> newscasts to one hour each. CBS was rele<mark>g</mark>ated to WZMQ-DT2 (displacin<mark>g</mark> both Start TV to WZMQ-DT4 and that subchannel's former Ion Television affiliation to the newly launched WZMQ-DT7), while addin<mark>g</mark> mornin<mark>g</mark> weather inserts and evenin<mark>g</mark> newscasts produced primarily out of WSEE/WICU's Erie News Now operation in downtown Erie. (As MeTV remained on WZMQ's main feed, the switch marked the first known instance of a "Bi<mark>g</mark> Four" network maintainin<mark>g</mark> a subchannel-only affiliation with a station primarily affiliated with a network intended for subchannel distribution.)

January 25	Alpena, Michi<mark>g</mark>an	WBKB-TV	11.2	Fox/MyNetworkTV (moved to 11.4)	NBC	On January 24, Marks Radio Group announced that WBKB-DT2 would switch to NBC the followin<mark>g</mark> day. In turn, the subchannel's former Fox, MyNetworkTV and syndicated pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> inventory was moved to a new DT4 subchannel of that station. The addition of NBC pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> results in the "Bi<mark>g</mark> Four" affiliations in the Alpena market becomin<mark>g</mark> controlled by the market's sole commercial station (WBKB-TV has been a primary CBS affiliate since its September 1975 si<mark>g</mark>n-on and has also carried ABC on its DT3 feed since January 2013) and <mark>g</mark>ave NBC local broadcast outlets in all 210 Nielsen DMAs. (The CW, affiliated with cable-only CW Plus outlet "WBAE", is the only remainin<mark>g</mark> major network not available over-the-air within the Alpena DMA.) Previously, NBC pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> had been provided to the area on cable and satellite via WTOM-TV/Cheboy<mark>g</mark>an, which provides frin<mark>g</mark>e over-the-air covera<mark>g</mark>e to Alpena.

In addition, KIKU will also serve as a secondary ABC affiliate for KITV, includin<mark>g</mark> simulcastin<mark>g</mark> its newscasts (as well as addin<mark>g</mark> an extra hour of its mornin<mark>g</mark> newscast) and re<mark>g</mark>ular syndicated pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark>.

WYCC	20.1	First Nations Experience	Chica<mark>g</mark>o, Illinois	June 1	Chica<mark>g</mark>o's former official second member station for PBS, WYCC, sees its license returned by its owners and si<mark>g</mark>ns off permanently. The station, which had launched as WXXW by Window to the World Communications (founders and owners of primary PBS station WTTW) in 1965, had a history of 'secondhand' status in the Chica<mark>g</mark>o market, bein<mark>g</mark> ne<mark>g</mark>lected in its first WTTW ownership and <mark>g</mark>oin<mark>g</mark> silent in 1974 due to transmitter disrepair. Sold to the City Colle<mark>g</mark>es of Chica<mark>g</mark>o in 1983, it returned to the air as a city-focused educational service with a popular afternoon homework helpline pro<mark>g</mark>ram, other local pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark>, and British import pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> and secondary PBS content fillin<mark>g</mark> its schedule, but also faced the whims of Chica<mark>g</mark>o politics, with mayors and city councils varyin<mark>g</mark> their fundin<mark>g</mark> over the years. It (alon<mark>g</mark> with Northwest Indiana PBS member station WYIN) also faced continued hostility from Window to the World, which continually an<mark>g</mark>led to be the exclusive PBS member station for Chica<mark>g</mark>oland and disallowed any attempt by either station to diversify and compete, usin<mark>g</mark> their role as a national pro<mark>g</mark>rammin<mark>g</mark> provider to stop any such attempts for both stations.
By 2017, the City Colle<mark>g</mark>es sold WYCC's spectrum durin<mark>g</mark> the FCC spectrum auction for nearly $16 million, intendin<mark>g</mark> for it to si<mark>g</mark>n off by the end of 2017, but was pressured to sell to another party to preserve its format. Window to the World re-acquired the station's license by March 2018, enterin<mark>g</mark> into a technical channel sharin<mark>g</mark> a<mark>g</mark>reement with WTTW to keep WYCC alive, but did not rehire any WYCC staff, and soon reduced it to an unpublicized passthrou<mark>g</mark>h of the FNX Native American-focused network. WTTW ran into its own fundin<mark>g</mark> issues durin<mark>g</mark> the pandemic and decided to relinquish the WYCC license to save the money bein<mark>g</mark> used for WYCC's re<mark>g</mark>ulatory compliance, alon<mark>g</mark> with the FNX affiliation. In technicality, the launch of World Channel on WYCC's former spectrum share as WTTW-DT5 replaced it.

 With its move to the streamin<mark>g</mark> service, first-run episodes of Days of Our Lives—which had been available to its free and paid users as an NBC pro<mark>g</mark>ram—will be paywalled to subscribers of Peacock's premium tiers. Days will become only the third soap opera to move from broadcast to streamin<mark>g</mark> (followin<mark>g</mark> the short-lived revivals of All My Children and One Life to Live—which ended their linear runs on ABC in September 2011 and January 2012, respectively—on Hulu in 2013), and its departure from NBC leaves CBS’s The Youn<mark>g</mark> and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, and ABC’s General Hospital as the only remainin<mark>g</mark> soap operas carried on U.S. broadcast television.
 YouTube TV's HBO Max add-on consists of in-app access to live feeds of the seven linear HBO channels and VOD content from the premium channel, and provider lo<mark>g</mark>in access to the HBO Max app. (The vMVPD also offers a standalone HBO add-on without lo<mark>g</mark>in access to HBO Max, which requires a subscription to its base channel packa<mark>g</mark>e to purchase.)
 In the Jacksonville DMA, CBS affiliate WJAX—which Cox operates under a joint sales a<mark>g</mark>reement with owner Hoffman Communications—was not involved in the dispute as it is covered by a separate carria<mark>g</mark>e contract from that of virtual duopoly partner WFOX.
 The HBO add-on ori<mark>g</mark>inally sold throu<mark>g</mark>h Prime Video from December 2016 until its removal had offered in-app access to the network's VOD library content and live streams of its linear channels; authenticated lo<mark>g</mark>-in access to the standalone HBO Max app was also made available to subscribers of the add-on as part of a December 2020 a<mark>g</mark>reement that also made the app available for download on Amazon Fire and Fire TV devices. The ori<mark>g</mark>inal add-on’s addition to Prime Video Channels was part of a broader a<mark>g</mark>reement reached between Time Warner and Amazon in 2016 that also allowed Prime Video subscribers to be able to purchase sister premium service Cinemax as a separate add-on.

On 2 June, Mahuta introduced the Water Services Entities Bill as the first of several new bills to entrench the Three Waters reform pro<mark>g</mark>ramme into law. The proposed bill would establish the four re<mark>g</mark>ional water services entities which would take over mana<mark>g</mark>ement of water infrastructure from the 67 local councils. While councils would retain ownership of their water assets throu<mark>g</mark>h a "community share" arran<mark>g</mark>ement, the new water service entities would exercise effective control over the water assets. Mahuta also confirmed that further le<mark>g</mark>islation would be introduced to facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities from local authorities to the Water Services Entities, inte<mark>g</mark>rate entities into other re<mark>g</mark>ulatory systems, and to ensure economic re<mark>g</mark>ulation and consumer protection over the new entities.[511][512][513] The opposition National and ACT parties claimed that the proposed bill amounted to the theft of local water assets, bureaucratic centralisation, and would inflame ethnic divisions.[512] Communities 4 Local Democracy leader and Manawatū District Mayor Helen Worboys opposed the bill on the <mark>g</mark>rounds that it would take local community assets without compensation.[513]

The first NZ$116 payment was released on 1 Au<mark>g</mark>ust with the second and third payments followin<mark>g</mark> on 1 September and 1 October 2022.[528][529] The rollout was pla<mark>g</mark>ued by reports that overseas-based New Zealanders were receivin<mark>g</mark> payments since the Inland Revenue Department had opted to dispense the payments automatically rather than manually check the eli<mark>g</mark>ibility of tax residents. The opposition National Party accused the Government of wastin<mark>g</mark> taxpayer money.[530]

On 11 October, Prime Minister Ardern announced plans to tax the emissions produced by farm animals by 2025. A<mark>g</mark>ricultural emissions by farm animals includin<mark>g</mark> burpin<mark>g</mark> and urination account for about half of New Zealand's emissions. The Government's proposal was criticised by Federated Farmers national president Andrew Ho<mark>g</mark><mark>g</mark>ard, who said it would hurt the farmin<mark>g</mark> sector by discoura<mark>g</mark>in<mark>g</mark> farmers from makin<mark>g</mark> a livin<mark>g</mark>. Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand's lead climate campai<mark>g</mark>ner Christine Rose claimed the Government's proposed tax on a<mark>g</mark>ricultural emissions was insufficient and favoured dairy producers over beef and sheep farmers and Māori landowners.[546][547]

In mid November 2022, the Government introduced two new bills, the Natural and Built Environment Bill (NBA) and the Spatial Plannin<mark>g</mark> Bill (SPA), as part of its efforts to replace the Resource Mana<mark>g</mark>ement Act 1991 (RMA). The NBA replaces the Government's environmental policy statements with a National Plannin<mark>g</mark> Framework (NPF). Under the NPF framework, all 15 re<mark>g</mark>ions will be required to develop a Natural and Built Environment Plan (NBE) that will replace the 100 district and re<mark>g</mark>ional plans, harmonisin<mark>g</mark> consentin<mark>g</mark> and plannin<mark>g</mark> rules. An independent national Māori entity will also be established to provide input into the NPF and ensure compliance with the Treaty of Waitan<mark>g</mark>i's provisions. The SSPA will deal with lon<mark>g</mark>-term plannin<mark>g</mark>. Local committees will be required to develop 30-year re<mark>g</mark>ional spatial strate<mark>g</mark>ies (RSS) for re<mark>g</mark>ional NBEs.[553][554] In response, the opposition National and ACT parties criticised the Government's proposed overhaul of the RMA le<mark>g</mark>islation on the <mark>g</mark>rounds that it created more centralisation, bureaucracy, and did little to reform the problems associated with the RMA process. The Green Party expressed concerns about what it perceived as the lack of environment protection in the two bills.[555][556]

On 5 December, Ardern and Verrall formally announced that the Government would be holdin<mark>g</mark> a Royal Commission of Inquiry into its COVID-19 pandemic response. The inquiry will be chaired by Australian-based epidemiolo<mark>g</mark>ist Tony Blakely, former National Party cabinet minister Hekia Parata, and former Treasury secretary John Whitehead. The inquiry is expected to be launched on 1 February 2023 and finish in mid-2024. It will examine the overall pandemic response includin<mark>g</mark> the health response, border mana<mark>g</mark>ement, community care, isolation, quarantine, and the economic response includin<mark>g</mark> monetary policy.
