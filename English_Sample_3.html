On January 6, 2021, supporters of President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden by attacking the U.S. Capitol Building, disrupting the joint session of Congress assembled to count electoral votes to formalize Joe Biden's victory.[1] By the end of the month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened more than 400 case files and issued more than 500 subpoenas and search warrants related to the riot.[2] The FBI also created a website to solicit tips from the public specifically related to the riot[3] and were especially assisted by the crowdsourced sleuthing of a group that calls themselves "Sedition Hunters."[4] By the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[5][6] By the second anniversary of the attack, that number had risen to 978.[7] Those prosecutions are handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C.[8]

On January 7, 2021, Michael R. Sherwin, the interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, said rioters could be charged with seditious conspiracy or insurrection.[9] He further suggested that Trump could be investigated for comments he made to his supporters before they stormed the Capitol and that others who "assisted or facilitated or played some ancillary role" in the events could also be investigated.[9] Early on, the majority of charges filed were for disorderly conduct and unlawful entry,[10] but eventually, some people were charged with seditious conspiracy.

Also on January 7, 2021, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said that any rioter who entered the Capitol should be added to the federal No Fly List.[11] Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe and inspector general David C. Williams argued Trump could face criminal charges for inciting the riot.[12]

Many have been charged with assault on law enforcement officers; "violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol ground";[13] trespassing; disrupting Congress; theft or other property crimes; weapons offenses; making threats; and conspiracy.[14] Some criminal indictments are under seal. The majority of cases are in federal court, while others are in D.C. Superior Court.[15]

Criminal investigations
Days after the attack, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said he was specifically looking at whether to charge Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and Mo Brooks with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol Building, and indicated that he might consider charging Donald Trump when he has left office.[16] Calls for Trump to be prosecuted for inciting the crowd to storm the Capitol Building also were made in the aftermath of the event.[17] D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said, "We saw an unprecedented attack on our American democracy incited by the United States president. He must be held accountable. His constant and divisive rhetoric led to the abhorrent actions we saw today."[18] Legal experts have stated that charging Trump with incitement would be difficult under Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court ruling which established that for speech to be considered criminally inciting, it must have been intended to incite "imminent lawless action" and "likely to incite or produce such action".[19]

On January 7, 2021, Michael Sherwin, interim U.S Attorney for the District of Columbia, expressed willingness to charge any Capitol Police officer found to have assisted the rioters.[20]

On February 10, 2021, CNN reported that the FBI, investigating the death of Brian Sicknick, was in the process of narrowing down a list of potential suspects.[21] On February 26, the agency reportedly identified one suspect of focus, according to sources.[22]

In March 2021, Sherwin said "almost all" of the cases charged in federal court involved "significant federal felonies" with sentences between five and twenty years.[13]

The New York Times reported in March 2021 that the FBI was investigating communications between an unnamed associate of the White House and an unnamed member of Proud Boys during the days prior to the incursion. The communications had been detected by examining cellphone metadata and were separate from previously known contacts between Roger Stone and Proud Boys.[23]

On March 2, 2022, the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack stated in a court filing that they had enough evidence for "a good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy". In December 2022, the committee recommended President Trump, John Eastman, and potentially others be charged with four types of criminal acts. The congressional committee cannot open criminal investigations, but the Justice Department is investigating Trump and his allies for criminal attempts to overturn the election.[24][25]

On November 18, 2022, United States Attorney General Merrick Garland named Jack Smith as special counsel to investigate the January 6 attack and Trump's handling of government documents.[26]

Notable sentences
On March 8, 2022, the first criminal trial involving one of the rioters, Guy Reffitt, ended with a jury conviction.[27] Reffitt was subsequently sentenced to 87 months in federal prison.[28]

On August 11, 2022, Thomas Robertson was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.[29]

On August 26, 2022, Howard Richardson was sentenced to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. He had struck a police officer three times with a flagpole, hard enough to break the flagpole. He had been arrested in November 2021 and had pleaded guilty in April 2022.[30]

On September 1, 2022, Thomas Webster was sentenced to 10 years in prison.[31]

On September 22, 2022, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli was sentenced to four years.[32]

On October 27, 2022, Albuquerque Cosper Head was sentenced to seven years and six months (90 months) in prison. He had dragged Metropolitan Police Department officer Mike Fanone into the mob.[33]

On December 5, 2022, Suzanne Ianni was sentenced to 15 days in prison for disorderly conduct. Ianni was formerly an elected member of the town meeting of Natick, Massachusetts, a member of Super Happy Fun America, and organizer of a Boston Straight Pride Parade.[34]

On December 9, 2022, Ronald Sandlin was sentenced to more than five years. Sandlin followed the QAnon ideology. He and two other men had driven from Tennessee to Washington, DC in a rental car filled with weapons, and he had assaulted police officers. He had pled guilty.[35]

On January 6, 2023, Jerod Wade Hughes was sentenced to 46 months. As the eighth rioter to enter the Capitol, he climbed into the building through a broken window and helped kick open the Senate wing door so others could enter. He had pled guilty.[36]

On January 27, 2023, Julian Khater was sentenced to 80 months. He used pepper spray to assault Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died the next day after suffering strokes.[37]

On February 9, 2023, Kevin Seefried was sentenced to three years. He carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol and used the flagpole to fend off a police officer.[38]

On February 24, 2023, David Mehaffie was sentenced to 14 months. He was a co-defendant at trial with Tristan Chandler Stevens and Patrick McCaughey III, who were sentenced later and received longer sentences.[39]

On March 14, 2023, Tristan Chandler Stevens was sentenced to five years. He assaulted police officers while attempting to break into the Capitol.[40]

On March 23, 2023, Riley June Williams was sentenced to three years. She stole the laptop of Nancy Pelosi with the intent on selling it to Russian foreign intelligence services and attempted to wipe all evidence of her crimes, after bragging about her involvement, in the days following the assault.[41]

On April 11, 2023, Robert Sanford was sentenced to four years and four months. He hit two police officers in the head with a fire extinguisher and threw a traffic cone at another officer.[42]

On April 14, 2023, Vincent J. Gillespie was sentenced to five years and eight months. He grabbed a police shield from officers, rammed it into them and pulled another officer into the mob of protestors.[43]

On April 14, 2023, Patrick McCaughey III was sentenced to seven years and six months. He crushed a police officer in a doorframe with a riot shield.[44]

On April 28, 2023, Jeffrey Scott Brown received a sentence of 54 months. He assaulted police with pepper spray.[45]

On May 5, 2023, Peter Schwartz was sentenced to 14 years and 2 months in prison, the longest sentence associated with the attack delivered to date. He sprayed a "super soaker" canister of pepper spray at retreating officers. He had 38 prior convictions over the previous 30 years.[46]

Investigations into alleged foreign involvement and payments
On December 8, 2020, French programmer Laurent Bachelier gave around $500,000 in bitcoin payments to alt-right figures and groups. About half of these funds went to Nick Fuentes, the leader of the online Groyper Army, who denied breaching the building. The day after the transfer, Bachelier killed himself.[47][48] The FBI is investigating whether any of this money financed illegal acts.[49]

The FBI is also investigating whether foreign adversaries of the U.S. – governments, organizations or individuals – provided financial support to people who attacked the Capitol.[49]

Separately, a joint threat assessment issued by the FBI, DHS, and other agencies said that "Russian, Iranian, and Chinese influence actors have seized the opportunity to amplify narratives in furtherance of their policy interest amid the presidential transition" and that these governments, through state actors, state media, and their proxies, used the riots to promote violence and extremism in the United States, denigrate American democracy, and in some instance promote conspiratorial claims.[49]

Numbers of people involved

About 2,000 people "are believed to have been involved with the siege," the FBI told Congress in June 2021.[50][51]

As of October 2021, approximately 250 people were still wanted for assaulting police officers.[52]

By January 6, 2023, the second anniversary of the attack, at least 978 people had been charged with federal crimes.[7]

Early numbers
The day after the storming of the Capitol, the FBI and D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department asked the public for help identifying the rioters.[53][54] Within three weeks, the FBI had received more than 200,000 digital media tips from the public.[15][2] At least one person was harassed after being incorrectly identified as a participant in the riots by members of the public. His personal information had been doxed, and he reported receiving harassing phone calls and posts on social media.[55]

In a press conference on January 12, 2021, Steven D'Antuono from the FBI announced the agency's expectation to arrest hundreds of people in the coming months, as it sorts through the vast amount of evidence submitted by the public. The charge brought against most rioters would likely include accusations of sedition and conspiracy.[56]

On January 8, 2021, the Justice Department announced charges against 13 people in connection with the Capitol riot in federal district court, while more had been charged in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[57][58] Three days later, the FBI and the Department of Justice were working to track down over 150 suspects. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen instructed federal prosecutors to send all cases back to DC for prosecution.[59]

As of January 13, 2021, over 50 public sector employees and elected officials and over a dozen Capitol police officers were facing internal investigations to determine their possible complicity in the riot.[60]

Demographics
Many participants were tied to extremist or fringe movements,[61] including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, Patriot Front,[62] Texas Freedom Force,[13] Super Happy Fun America, Woodland Wild Dogs, and America First Bruins.[63] About a third of defendants had ties to such groups, according to a June 2022 estimate.[63]

The majority, however, were not affiliated with a specific far-right group and had been more informally radicalized by right-wing Internet, social media, or television.[62][64] At least 15% had ties to the military or law enforcement.[61] About 40% were business owners or white-collar workers; only about 9% were unemployed.[62] A Washington Post review of public records showed that of defendants with enough information to identify financial histories, almost 60% had experienced financial problems over the preceding 20 years.[62] Some 18% had a past bankruptcy (nearly double the rate of the general public), 20% had prior eviction and foreclosure proceedings, 25% had been sued by a creditor for not paying money owed; and others had bad debt, delinquent taxes, or tax liens.[62] Many clearly expressed a belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory.[14] While the majority of those charged were men, 25 women were also charged.[13] Among those whose age was known, the average age was 41 years; the youngest charged was 18, and the oldest was 81.[13][65] Those who were arrested came from 47 states, with the largest numbers coming from Texas, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania.[13] At least 27 had previous criminal records;[64] with at least nine having been previously accused of, or convicted of, committing violence against women (including one who had served five years in prison for rape and sexual battery), or had been the subject of domestic violence restraining orders.[66] 90% of those arrested were White Americans.[67]

By the end of February 2021, CNN was aware of "nearly a dozen" defendants who admitted that, to their knowledge, the other Capitol rioters were all Trump supporters and that the riot had not been (as Trump's lawyers and some congressional Republicans had attempted to claim) a left-wing "false-flag" performance to pin blame on Trump supporters.[68] On March 2, FBI Director Chris Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that there was no evidence that the rioters had been faking their support for Trump.[69]

Arguments raised by defendants
By the end of August, according to CNN's tally, crowdfunding campaigns had raised over $2 million (combined) for the legal defenses of dozens of defendants.[70]

Inspired by Trump
Within weeks, several defendants had already used the comments of President Trump in their legal defenses.[71][72] One said, "I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do."[73] A month after the riot, an ABC News investigation found that, of about two hundred accused individuals facing federal charges, at least fifteen had claimed that they acted based on Trump's encouragement. A person who threatened to assassinate Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during the riot said: "I believed I was following the instructions of former President Trump. I also left Washington and started back to Texas immediately after President Trump asked us to go home."[74] In February 2021, a lawyer for Jacob Angeli told CNN that Trump had inspired the storming of the Capitol using "Trump Talk" and propaganda. Angeli hung on Trump's every word as did millions of other Americans, the lawyer said, adding that Angeli's experience in police custody resembled being deprogrammed from a cult.[75]

In January 2022, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors were asking defense attorneys of indicted rioters if their clients would admit in sworn statements that they stormed the Capitol believing Trump wanted them to stop Pence from certifying the election. One member of Proud Boys who pleaded guilty said he had conspired with other members to "send a message to legislators and Vice President Pence." Another rioter stated in her guilty plea that she marched on the Capitol specifically after hearing Trump encourage Pence to "do the right thing."[76] In April 2022, a defense lawyer for one of the rioters told jurors that Trump had been "using his position to authorize this assault."[77]

Before their trials, Stewart Rhodes and several Oath Keeper defendants who participated in the insurrection sought to use a "public authority" defense arguing that they should be immune from criminal liability because they relied on Trump's orders.[78][79] (Such a defense is also called "entrapment-by-estoppel").[80] U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, in ruling on pretrial motions, barred the defendants from raising such a defense, noting that Trump had no authority to call the defendants to action on January 6.[79]

Ignorance
By February 2021, at least 39 criminal defendants claimed in court filings that they believed that they were free to enter the Capitol during the riot, as law enforcement officers did not attempt to stop them from entering and never told them they were not allowed to enter the building.[81]

One defendant, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli (a New Jersey right-wing extremist who had previously dressed as Hitler), was the fifth January 6 defendant to go to a jury trial. He testified in his May 2022 trial that he was an "idiot" who had not known that Congress met at the Capitol, despite having also testified that he was a "history buff" who closely tracked the electoral college process.[82] The jury convicted Hale-Cusanelli on all five counts, and after the verdict was rendered Judge Trevor N. McFadden said he would consider giving a sentencing enhancement to Hale-Cusanelli because of the "highly dubious" nature of his testimony.[82] At the September 2022 sentencing hearing (in which Hale-Cusanelli was sentenced to four years), McFadden said that Hale-Cusanelli had lied under oath, telling him, "You absolutely knew what you and others were doing."[83]

Trump's consideration of presidential pardon
Several, including Jacob Angeli, reportedly hoped for Presidential pardons before Trump left office.[84] During the two weeks following the attack and before he left office, Trump seriously considered a blanket pardon. It was deemed unfeasible because it would apply to a large, undefined group of people, many of whom had not yet been charged nor even identified. Concern was also expressed that White House counsel Pat Cipollone might quit if Trump were to attempt a blanket pardon.[85] On January 29, 2022, when over 760 people had been charged,[86] Trump said at a Texas rally that he would be inclined to pardon the rioters if he were reelected in 2024.[87] He repeated the promise at a Tennessee rally in June 2022.[88] In November, four days before the midterm elections, he said: "Let them all go now!"[89] On May 10, 2023, he said he would be "inclined to pardon many of them" while hedging by saying "a couple of them, probably, they got out of control."[90]

Representative Adam Schiff, who serves on the House committee investigating the attack, told MSNBC in February 2022 that Trump's offer of pardons suggests that he "condoned" the violence.[91] Representative Pete Aguilar, who is also on the committee, told CNN the same day that he considers Trump's offer to be witness tampering.[92]

Specific arrests and charges

Seditious conspiracy
On March 2, 2022, Oath Keeper Joshua James pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, admitting in his plea that "from November 2020 through January 2021, he conspired with other Oath Keeper members and affiliates to use force to prevent, hinder and delay the execution of the laws of the United States governing the transfer of presidential power."[93][94] Stewart Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, also of the Oath Keepers, were found guilty of seditious conspiracy on November 29, 2022.[95]

On June 6, 2022, five members of the Proud Boys—their leader Enrique Tarrio, together with Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, Ethan Nordean and Dominic Pezzola—were indicted for seditious conspiracy.[96] On May 4, 2023, the jury delivered a partial verdict convicting all but Pezzola.[97]

Obstruction of an official proceeding
In March 2022, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled that the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding (18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)) must be limited to alleged tampering with documents.[98] However, in April 2023, an appellate court reversed this decision, so documents need not have been part of an alleged crime for a defendant to be charged with obstruction.[99]

Other
A list of Capitol breach cases is being kept updated by the US Attorney's Office, District of Columbia.[100] BuzzFeed has a searchable table of the plea deals.[101]

Most defendants face "two class-B misdemeanor counts for demonstrating in the Capitol and disorderly conduct, and two class-A misdemeanor counts for being in a restricted building and disruptive activity," according to BuzzFeed, and therefore most plea deals address those misdemeanors. Some defendants have been additionally charged with felonies.[102]

By February 1, 2021, 228 people from 39 states and DC had been charged with federal and/or DC offences.[103] By early September, there were over 600 federal defendants, 10% of whom had pled guilty,[104] and hundreds more arrests expected to come.[105] By October 13, there were 100 guilty pleas.[101] By the second anniversary of the attack, nearly 1,000 people had been federally charged.[7]

According to Politico, dozens of defendants "deemed to be dangerous, flight risks or at high risk of obstructing justice were ordered held without bond. D.C. jail officials later determined that all Capitol detainees would be placed in so-called restrictive housing."[106] U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized this decision, referring to it as solitary confinement, which she argued "is a form of punishment that is cruel and psychologically damaging."[106]

On October 15, 2021, Capitol Police Officer Michael A. Riley was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice for advising Jacob Hiles to remove incriminating posts from social media. The U.S. Capitol Police disclosed that they had known of the investigation into Riley's actions for several weeks, placed him on administrative suspension upon his arrest, and announced an internal affairs investigation into his actions.[269] Riley's trial began on October 18, 2022.

Under battle flags bearing Donald Trump's name, the Capitol's attackers pinned a bloodied police officer in a doorway, his twisted face and screams captured on video. They mortally wounded another officer with a blunt weapon and body-slammed a third over a railing into the crowd. 'Hang Mike Pence!' the rioters chanted as they pressed inside, beating police with pipes. They demanded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whereabouts, too. They hunted any and all lawmakers: 'Where are they?' Outside, makeshift gallows stood, complete with sturdy wooden steps and the noose. Guns and pipe bombs had been stashed in the vicinity. ... The mob got stirring encouragement from Trump and more explicit marching orders from the president's men. 'Fight like hell,' Trump exhorted his partisans at the staging rally. 'Let's have trial by combat,' implored his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, whose attempt to throw out election results in trial by courtroom failed. It's time to 'start taking down names and kicking ass', said Republican Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama. Criminals pardoned by Trump, among them Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, came forward at rallies on the eve of the attack to tell the crowds they were fighting a battle between good and evil

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In biological nomenclature, organisms often receive scientific names that honor a person. A taxon (e.g. species or genus; plural: taxa) named in honor of another entity is an eponymous taxon, and names specifically honoring a person or persons are known as patronyms. Scientific names are generally formally published in peer-reviewed journal articles or larger monographs along with descriptions of the named taxa and ways to distinguish them from other taxa. Following rules of Latin grammar, species or subspecies names derived from a man's name often end in -i or -ii if named for an individual, and -orum if named for a group of men or mixed-sex group, such as a family. Similarly, those named for a woman often end in -ae, or -arum for two or more women.

This list is part of the List of organisms named after famous people, and includes organisms named after famous individuals born between 1 January 1900 and 31 December 1949. It also includes ensembles (including bands and comedy troupes) in which at least one member was born within those dates; but excludes companies, institutions, ethnic groups or nationalities, and populated places. It does not include organisms named for fictional entities, for biologists, paleontologists or other natural scientists,[note 1] nor for associates or family members of researchers who are not otherwise notable; exceptions are made, however, for natural scientists who are much more famous for other aspects of their lives, such as, for example, Japanese emperors Hirohito and Akihito.

Sir David Attenborough was formerly included in this section of the list as one of these exceptions, since despite his formal training as a natural scientist, he is more widely known to the public as a documentary filmmaker. However, due to the high number of taxa named after him (over 50 as of 2022), he has been removed; his patronyms can be found in the List of things named after David Attenborough and his works.

Organisms named after famous people born earlier can be found in:

List of organisms named after famous people (born before 1800)
List of organisms named after famous people (born 1800–1899)
Organisms named after famous people born later can be found in:

List of organisms named after famous people (born 1950–present)
The scientific names are given as originally described (their basionyms): subsequent research may have placed species in different genera, or rendered them taxonomic synonyms of previously described taxa. Some of these names are unavailable in the zoological sense or illegitimate in the botanical sense due to senior homonyms already having the same name.

Agathidium bushi Miller & Wheeler, 2005	Beetle	George W. Bush	This beetle was named by Quentin D. Wheeler, and President Bush was pleased with the gesture, even calling Wheeler to thank him for the honor. Because of the problematic public image of Bush and his cabinet, and the fact that this is a slime-mold beetle which feeds on decaying fungi, some interpreted the naming to be intended as an insult; however, Wheeler clarified that this species, as well as A. cheneyi and A. rumsfeldi, were meant as homages: "We admire these leaders as fellow citizens who have the courage of their convictions and are willing to do the very difficult and unpopular work of living up to principles of freedom and democracy rather than accepting the expedient or popular". Co-author Kelly Miller said "We intended the names to be honorific... We were two conservatives in academia working together (which is not common). It was early in the Iraq war period, and we were both in favor of intervention there... And finally, we love our beetles! We wouldn't name a new species after someone we didn't like. [In interviews,] we compared it to the Lewis and Clark expedition naming the three forks of the Missouri after Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin (President, Vice President, and Secretary of the Treasury [at the time])."

"Surprisingly, DNA sequence data showed D. benthamii subsp. humilis to comprise two cryptic species that are more closely related to other species than to D. benthamii [...]. As they are unexpected and unlikely 'twins', we have named them after the actors who played an unlikely pair of twins in the eponymous Hollywood movie: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. We have named this species after Schwarzenegger because he is much more robust than his twin: 'The embryo did split in two, but it didn't split equally. All the purity and strength went into Julius [Schwarzenegger's character]'. This difference between the actors parallels the growth habit difference between the two Daviesia species.

Zimmerius chicomendesi Whitney, Schunck, Rêgo & Silveira2, 2013	Bird	Chico Mendes	"Francisco "Chico" Alves Mendes Filho (1944-1988) was a man wise beyond the borders of his time and space. He learned to use the Amazon rainforest by living in it and understood the fundamental importance of preservation of natural resources as well as the dire socio-economic consequences of their destruction – and [...] [he] was able to make that knowledge count in the international arena. We have no doubt that Mendes and his message, during the last few years of his short life, did more to educate such agencies as the Inter-American Development Bank to more wisely distribute funding toward sustainable uses in Amazonia than has any other individual. If Mendes were alive today, we cannot help but imagine that Brazil would be far ahead of where it is in the development of a truly sustainable Amazonia in reasonable harmony with indigenous peoples and colonists. In bringing this obscure little bird to the light of science, we call up the spirit of Chico Mendes to help us all get it right."

All statistics correct as of 14 May 2023.
The 2022–23 season is the 137th season in the history of Arsenal Football Club and the club's 104th consecutive season in the top flight of English football. In addition to the domestic league, Arsenal competed in the FA Cup, the EFL Cup and the UEFA Europa League, the latter of which was their 37th European campaign.

The season covers the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. Notably, the fixture dates of domestic and European competitions were altered to accommodate the FIFA World Cup played in November and December 2022 in Qatar.

Review
Background
On 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain Mikel Arteta – who was 37 years old then and had never managed before – as the new head coach on a three-and-a-half-year deal.[3][4][5] The 2019–20 season had been defined by a three-month lull between March and June, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and when it returned, it was behind closed doors.[6][7] The Gunners finished the league season in eighth place – far from a European qualification spot; but they earned a record-extending 14th FA Cup win on 1 August 2020, helping them qualify for next season's Europa League, and making Arteta the first person to win the FA Cup as both captain and coach of the club.[8]

The 2020–21 season was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as lots of domestic and European games were played behind closed doors. After Arsenal triumphed in the 2020 FA Community Shield, Arteta's title was changed to manager.[9][10] On 26 December 2020, the Gunners recorded an important victory at home to end their seven-game run without a win in the Premier League and relieve the pressure on Arteta.[11] On 18 April 2021, Arsenal were announced as a founding club of the breakaway European competition The Super League; they withdrew from the competition two days later amid near-universal condemnation.[12] The Gunners finished the season in eighth place once again, this time not qualifying for a European competition for the first time in 25 years.[13][14]

The 2021–22 season, which was documented in the Amazon Prime Video series All or Nothing: Arsenal,[15][16] was a rollercoaster season for the Gunners.[17][18] With their three consecutive defeats to open the Premier League campaign, the club dropped to 20th, sitting at the bottom of the table, which was their worst start to a season for 67 years.[19][20] Since then, a new look Arsenal started to emerge, with several academy graduates and new signings making a major impact.[21] In fact, the Gunners were the youngest team in the 2021–22 Premier League with an average starting age of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year younger than the next team.[22][23] Arteta's Arsenal rebuild on and off the pitch began to take shape in this season,[24][25] with the Gunners moving into the top four for several times between December 2021 and May 2022. On 6 May 2022, the club announced that the Spaniard had signed a new contract to the end of the 2024–25 campaign.[26][27] Arsenal finished the league season in fifth place, narrowly missing out on Champions League football.[28][29]

Pre-season

It was reported on 29 June 2022 that the first-team players who were not in action for their respective countries since the end of the last campaign were back to the London Colney training ground for pre-season training.[30]

On 4 July, the Gunners travelled to Germany for a mini training camp at Adidas headquarters in Herzogenaurach.[31][32] Five academy players – Salah-Eddine Oulad M'Hand, Charlie Patino, Matt Smith, Lino Sousa and Reuell Walters – were with the first-team squad.[33]

Four days later, Arsenal faced 2. Bundesliga side 1. FC Nürnberg at Max-Morlock-Stadion in Nuremberg. New signings Gabriel Jesus, Marquinhos and Matt Turner made their non-competitive debuts for the club in a 5–3 win.[34] They returned to England on the next day.

On 11 July, Arsenal confirmed that the internationals who were in action for their respective countries in June were all back to London Colney.[35] Two days later, manager Arteta named a 33-man squad for the trip to the United States where they would play three more friendlies. The 17-year-old defender Reuell Walters was the only academy player to travel with the first team to the US.[36]

The Gunners faced fellow Premier League side Everton at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland on 16 July. Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka both scored one goal in the first half, helping the team win 2–0.[37] Four days later, Arsenal took on Major League Soccer side Orlando City at Exploria Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The Gunners won 3–1 with Gabriel Martinelli scoring the opener, Eddie Nketiah scoring the second, and Reiss Nelson scoring the third.[38]

On 23 July, the club played their third and final game of the USA tour – also the final game of the 2022 Florida Cup series – against Premier League side Chelsea at Camping World Stadium in Orlando. New signing Oleksandr Zinchenko made his non-competitive debut for Arsenal. In the 15th minute, Gabriel Jesus put the Gunners ahead with his fourth goal of pre-season. On 36 minutes, Martin Ødegaard added a further goal by sliding his shot low into the net. Saka scored the third shortly after the hour mark. Albert Sambi Lokonga headed in a cross from Cédric Soares at the far post in the closing stages, making the score 4–0. Arsenal ended the 10-day trip to America with winning the Florida Cup.[39]

The Gunners finished their pre-season campaign by thrashing La Liga side Sevilla 6–0 to claim the 2022 Emirates Cup on 30 July. The match saw four goals in the opening 20 minutes, courtesy of braces from Saka and Gabriel Jesus, with the Brazilian completing his treble on 77 minutes before Nketiah netted in the final minute.[40]

Before the start of the game against Sevilla, Arsenal announced that Ødegaard was named their new men's first-team captain.[41][42]

First-team transfers (summer transfer window)

Saliba with Marseille in January 2022
Last season, French centre-back William Saliba spent a year on loan with Marseille in Ligue 1.[43] During his time with Marseille, Saliba made 52 appearances in all competitions, and helped the club to second in the league, whilst also reaching the semi-finals of the inaugural Europa Conference League season. Saliba was named as Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year and was awarded a position in the Team of the Year.[44][45] He also won his first caps for France.[46][47] In early June 2022, Saliba confirmed he would return to north London from his Marseille loan spell.[47] He would wear the number 12 shirt from the 2022–23 season.

On 19 May 2022, three days before the last game of the 2021–22 season, Arsenal announced that Greek defender Konstantinos Mavropanos joined Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart in a permanent transfer.[48] On 24 May, the club confirmed that Egyptian midfielder Mohamed Elneny had signed a new contract.[49] On 10 June, Arsenal announced that they were to release nine players, two of whom, Alexandre Lacazette and Nketiah, made men's first-team appearances for the Gunners.[50] Eight days later, the club confirmed English striker and academy graduate Nketiah signed a new long-term contract, and would wear the number 14 shirt from the 2022–23 season, having previously worn the number 30.[51] The departure of French midfielder Matteo Guendouzi to Ligue 1 side Marseille was announced on 1 July.[52][53] Two weeks later, the Gunners confirmed American defender Auston Trusty joined EFL Championship side Birmingham City F.C. on a season-long loan.[54]

Arsenal announced their first signing of the summer transfer window on 10 June, with 19-year-old Brazilian forward Marquinhos joining the club on a long-term contract from Série A side São Paulo.[55][56] Eleven days later, the club announced the signing of 22-year-old Portuguese midfielder Fábio Vieira from Primeira Liga side Porto. He was given the number 21 shirt.[57]

On 27 June, the Gunners confirmed that 28-year-old American goalkeeper Matt Turner had joined the club from Major League Soccer side New England Revolution, and would wear the number 30 shirt.[58][59] As of June 2022, Turner had made 18 appearances for the United States.[58][59] He wore the number one shirt and played every game as USA won the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup as hosts, keeping five clean sheets in the tournament, and earning the Golden Glove award.[60][61] He was also honoured as MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 2021.[62] Turner has been an Arsenal fan since his teenage years.[59][63]


Jesus with Manchester City in 2018

Zinchenko playing for Manchester City in 2018
In July 2022, the Gunners announced two signings of notable players from fellow Premier League side Manchester City, where Arteta spent three years and a half at as an assistant coach to Pep Guardiola before returning to Arsenal as head coach.[3][4] On 4 July, 25-year-old Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus joined Arsenal on a long-term contract, and was assigned the number 9 shirt.[64][65] With the ability to play in several attacking positions, he is one of the leading strikers in the Premier League during his six seasons in Manchester City.[64][66] On 22 July, 25-year-old Ukrainian left-sided player and Arsenal supporter Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is comfortable operating in midfield and defence, joined the club on a long-term contract,[67][68][69] and would wear the number 35 shirt. Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko had both won four Premier League titles, the FA Cup and a number of EFL Cups as Manchester City players.[64][67] Manager Arteta believed that Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko would help bring a winning mentality to the young squad.[66][70]

The Gunners continued their summer exodus after signing five players. In late July, the club announced the loan departures of English goalkeeper and academy graduate Arthur Okonkwo and Portuguese defender Nuno Tavares to League Two side Crewe Alexandra and Ligue 1 side Marseille respectively.[71][72]

On 2 August, Arsenal announced German goalkeeper Bernd Leno, who had made 125 appearances for the club in all competitions, joined fellow Premier League side Fulham in a permanent transfer.[73][74] On the next day, the Gunners confirmed English goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale took the number one shirt, moving from his previous number 32 following Leno's move to Fulham.[75]

The departures of five first-team players were announced afterwards, as English forward and academy graduate Folarin Balogun joined Ligue 1 side Reims on a one-year loan,[76] Uruguayan midfielder Lucas Torreira completed his transfer to Süper Lig side Galatasaray,[77] Spanish defender Pablo Marí joined Serie A side A.C. Monza on a one-year loan deal,[78] Icelandic goalkeeper Rúnar Alex Rúnarsson joined Süper Lig side Alanyaspor on loan for the 2022–23 season,[79] and Ivorian winger Nicolas Pépé joined Ligue 1 side OGC Nice on a season-long loan.[80]

On transfer deadline day, 1 September, two first-team players departed the club. English midfielder and academy graduate Ainsley Maitland-Niles joined fellow Premier League side Southampton on a one-year loan.[81] Spanish defender and academy graduate Héctor Bellerín, who had made 239 first-team appearances in all competitions and won three FA Cups with the club, joined La Liga side Barcelona in a permanent transfer.[82]

After the summer transfer window closed, there were twenty-four players in the first-team squad: three goalkeepers, eight defenders, seven midfielders, and six forwards.[83]

August
Just like the 2021–22 season, the Gunners began their campaign with a London derby away in the Premier League's first fixture on Friday, 5 August 2022,[84][85] facing Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, managed by former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. Returning loanee Saliba and new signings Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko made their competitive debuts for the team, and new recruit Turner was named on the bench in a 2–0 win.[86] Martinelli opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a header assisted by Zinchenko, becoming the first Brazilian to net a season-opening goal of a Premier League campaign.[87][88][89] In the 85th minute, Saka's cross was deflected home by Marc Guéhi to ensure Arteta registered his 50th league victory,[88] making him the second-quickest manager to reach 50 top-flight wins for Arsenal after Arsène Wenger.[89][90]

Eight days later, the club played their first home match of the season against Leicester City.[91] Gabriel Jesus netted twice in the first half on his home debut, becoming the first player to score more than once on his home Premier League debut for Arsenal.[92] The visitors were awarded a penalty before half-time when striker Jamie Vardy and goalkeeper Ramsdale collided in the box, but the decision was overturned after referee Darren England checked the pitchside monitor.[93][94] Despite a Saliba own goal in the 53rd minute, Granit Xhaka scored just two minutes later. Moments after James Maddison scored for the Foxes, Martinelli netted in the 75th minute, making the score 4–2.[92][93][94]

It was reported on 15 August that manager Arteta appointed Xhaka and Gabriel Jesus as the team's vice-captains to support skipper Ødegaard.[95]

On 20 August, Arsenal continued their Premier League campaign, facing newly promoted Bournemouth away at Dean Court. Summer signing Vieira was named among the substitutes for the first time.[96] Ødegaard netted twice within the opening 11 minutes. Saliba scored with a left-footed curled shot from the edge of the box to the top right corner in the 54th minute, becoming the youngest Frenchman to score a Premier League goal for the Gunners since Samir Nasri in November 2008 vs Manchester United,[97] and sealing a 3–0 victory. The win vaulted them to the top of the Premier League for the first time since 17 January 2016 against Stoke City,[98][99] and ensured it was the first time Arsenal had won their opening three fixtures since the 2004–05 season.[100][101] Saka became the second youngest player to play 100 times for the club in the Premier League, behind Cesc Fàbregas.[97][102]

On 26 August, the draw for the Europa League group stage was made. Arsenal were drawn in Group A, along with Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, Norwegian champions Bodø/Glimt and Swiss champions Zürich.[103]

A day later, the Gunners played at home against newly promoted Fulham and former Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno,[104] who had signed with the Cottagers three days before the start of the Premier League season. Kieran Tierney and Elneny made their first Premier League starts of the season, because Zinchenko had suffered a slight sprain to his knee in training, and Thomas Partey had suffered a tight thigh before this game; new signing Marquinhos was on the bench for the first time.[105] In the 56th minute, Gabriel Magalhães hesitated to pick a pass and lost possession on the edge of his own box to allow Aleksandar Mitrović to put Fulham ahead. Eight minutes later, Ødegaard equalised with a deflected strike from Saka's pass. In the 85th minute, a Martinelli corner caused havoc in a congested box and Gabriel Magalhães redeemed himself with a scrambled finish from close range, making the score 2–1.[106][107] The win marked Arteta's 100th Premier League game in charge, and ensured it was the third time the club had won each of their first four games of a Premier League season, after 2003–04 and 2004–05. It was also the first time Arsenal conceded the first goal in the second half of a Premier League match and managed to come back and win since 26 December 2013 against West Ham United.[106][108]

It was reported on 30 August that midfielder Elneny suffered a significant injury in the match against Fulham.[109] He would be out for two months.[110]

Arsenal's last match of the month was against 15th-placed Aston Villa and former Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez at home on 31 August.[111] Albert Sambi Lokonga was handed his first start of the season as he replaced the injured Elneny.[112] In the 30th minute, Gabriel Jesus put his side in front by sweeping a low effort past Villa's Martínez after he had fumbled Xhaka's deflected shot. The visitors found an equaliser directly from Douglas Luiz's corner in the 74th minute, as goalkeeper Ramsdale protested that he was impeded by Boubacar Kamara. The Gunners regained their lead with Martinelli turning in Saka's pinpoint cross just three minutes later.[113][114][115] The 2–1 victory was Arsenal's 200th Premier League win since the club moved to Emirates Stadium from Highbury back in 2006.[113][116] It was the fourth time Arsenal had started a top-flight season with a run of five wins, after 1930–31, 1947–48 and 2004–05.[117][118] Arteta became the 11th manager to have won the first five games of a Premier League season, after Kevin Keegan, Carlo Ancelotti, Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, Alan Curbishley, José Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini, Pep Guardiola, Maurizio Sarri, and Jürgen Klopp.[119]

Arsenal's performances in August led to several Premier League monthly award nominations. After guiding the Gunners to wins in all five of their Premier League matches of the month, Arteta was named Premier League Manager of the Month, winning the award for the third time following his previous successes in September 2021 and March 2022.[120][121] Gabriel Jesus and Ødegaard, who both scored three goals in August, were nominated for Premier League Player of the Month.[122][123] Gabriel Jesus' chip against Leicester City and Saliba's strike against Bournemouth were both shortlisted for Premier League Goal of the Month.[124][125] Gabriel Jesus and Ødegaard were also nominated for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[126] Gabriel Jesus was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for August,[127] and Saliba's strike against Bournemouth was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[128]

September
The club started September with a 1–3 defeat at Old Trafford to rivals Manchester United on 4 September,[129] seeing their five-game winning start to the Premier League season come to an end. Zinchenko returnd to the starting line-up, while Arsenal's first two defensive midfielders – Partey and Elneny – were still injured.[130] In the 12th minute, Martinelli raced goalwards and finished past goalkeeper David de Gea, however video assistant referee Lee Mason suggested that referee Paul Tierney should check for a foul on Christian Eriksen by Ødegaard in the build-up to the goal, and he changed his on-field decision. In the 35th minute, Antony scored for the hosts. Saka levelled for the Gunners on the hour mark, ending his 10-game goal drought dating back to May. Marcus Rashford then netted twice in the 66th and 75th minute, helping the hosts to victory.[131][132][133] Despite the loss, Arsenal remained top of the table.[132] The game also saw new signing Vieira make his competitive debut for the team as a substitute in the 74th minute.[131][132] It was reported on 21 December 2022 that Martinelli's disallowed opener was one of the six incorrect VAR interventions in the first part of the Premier League season before the break for the World Cup.[134][135]

After missing out on continental action last term, the Gunners began their fifth Europa League campaign on 8 September with a trip to Switzerland in a group stage match against Zürich,[136] the reigning Swiss Super League champions. This was the first time the two teams played each other in a European game.[103] New signings Marquinhos and Turner made their competitive debuts, and fellow new recruit Vieira got his full debut in a 2–1 win. In the 16th minute, Arsenal took the lead through Marquinhos converting from Nketiah's cutback. Zürich equalised in the 44th minute courtesy of Mirlind Kryeziu's penalty after Nketiah fouled Fidan Aliti inside the box.[137][138][139] At half-time, the news broke of the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,[140] and Arsenal's players returned to the field wearing black armbands in respect, while a minute's silence was held before the start of the second half.[137][139] In the 62nd minute, Nketiah atoned for his earlier error by heading the deciding goal at the far post from Marquinho's cross,[137][138] becoming the fifth Englishman to score in three consecutive starts in the Europa League.[141] The winner prompted a muted response from players on the pitch as well as manager Arteta, who also wore a black armband, on the sidelines in light of the news from Buckingham Palace.[139]

Arsenal's home fixture against Everton, which was originally due to be played on 11 September, was postponed two days beforehand along with the entire weekend's English football league programme,[142][143][144] as a mark of respect following the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.[140][145] The Europa League group stage match between Arsenal and Eredivisie side PSV Eindhoven, originally scheduled to be played on 15 September, was postponed due to the severe limitations on police resources and organisational issues related to the ongoing events surrounding the national mourning for Queen Elizabeth II.[146][147] It was announced on 14 September that the league match between Arsenal and Manchester City, which was originally scheduled for 19 October, was postponed to accommodate Arsenal's rearranged Europa League fixture against PSV Eindhoven, following discussions between UEFA, the Premier League and relevant clubs.[148][149][150]

Ahead of the first international break of the season, the Gunners faced 8th-placed Brentford away at Brentford Community Stadium on 18 September.[151] Before kick-off, there was a minute's silence in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, followed by a rendition of the national anthem "God Save the King".[152][153] In the 17th minute, Saliba opened the scoring with a header from Saka's corner. Eleven minutes later, Gabriel Jesus doubled Arsenal's advantage with another header from Xhaka's chip. In the 49th minute, Vieira collected a Saka pass in space outside the Brentford box and unleashed a strike that crashed in off the post, marking his first Premier League start, and sealing a 3–0 win.[154] Nketiah made his 100th appearance for the team as a substitute in the 78th minute.[152] As a schoolboy midfielder at the age of 15 years and 181 days, Ethan Nwaneri came off the bench to replace Vieira in second-half stoppage time. He became the youngest player to ever appear in the Premier League[154] – breaking the record previously held by Harvey Elliott,[153][155] and the all-time English top-flight record held since August 1964 by former Sunderland goalkeeper Derek Forster, by three days.[156][157] He also became Arsenal's youngest-ever player in any competition, breaking the previous record of 16 years and 177 days, set by Cesc Fàbregas in the 2003–04 League Cup.[157][158] In the post-match presser, manager Arteta explained that they had to name Nwaneri and two other under-21 players on the bench because the first team had several injuries, especially the injury of midfielder Ødegaard, and a "gut feeling" was behind his decision to send Nwaneri on.[159][160]

Ten Arsenal first-team players (excluding players who were loaned out) were named in their respective countries' senior squads for international fixtures in September: Ramsdale and Saka (England), Karl Hein (Estonia), Saliba (France), Partey (Ghana), Takehiro Tomiyasu (Japan), Ødegaard (as Norway's captain), Tierney (Scotland), Xhaka (as Switzerland's captain), and Turner (United States).[161][162]

On 29 September, Arsenal announced that academy graduate Emile Smith Rowe had undergone surgery to repair a damaged tendon in his groin. He would return to full training in December.[163][164]

Gabriel Jesus's impressive form was recognised with a nomination for September's PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month.[165] Xhaka was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for September,[166] and Vieira's strike against Brentford was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[167]

October
October 2022 was a gruelling month for Arsenal. They played five Premier League matches and four Europa League matches in 29 days, including two home games against Tottenham and Liverpool, and two games away to Norwegian side Bodø/Glimt and Dutch side PSV Eindhoven.

On 1 October, following the international break, it was North London derby day in the league as the club played at home to 3rd-placed Tottenham.[168] Partey opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a right-footed curled shot from 25 yards assisted by Ben White. It was the first time Partey scored from outside the box for Arsenal, with what was his 65th attempt in all competitions.[169][170] Spurs equalised in the 31st minute courtesy of Harry Kane's penalty after Gabriel Magalhães fouled Richarlison inside the box.[171] In the 49th minute, Gabriel Jesus capitalised on a mix-up between goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and defender Cristian Romero to put the Gunners in front from close range shortly after Lloris spilled a Saka shot. On 62 minutes, Emerson Royal's reckless foul tackle from behind on Martinelli prompted referee Anthony Taylor to produce a straight red card.[171] Five minutes later, Xhaka drilled a low shot past Lloris from the centre of the box, making the score 3–1. The win kept Arsenal on top of the Premier League table, and meant that it was the first time the club had won each of their last three Premier League home games against Tottenham since September 2013.[169][170]

The Gunners resumed their Europa League campaign on 6 October with a home game against Bodø/Glimt,[172] the defending Eliteserien champions. This was the first time the two teams met in a European competition.[103] American goalkeeper Turner made his home debut and kept his first clean sheet for Arsenal in a 3–0 win.[173] Nketiah netted on his fourth Europa League start in a row by tapping home the rebound from Tierney's strike in the 23rd minute.[174] Four minutes later, Vieira crossed for Rob Holding at the back post to head in a second.[173] On 84 minutes, Gabriel Jesus danced past several defenders in the box to tee up Vieira to fire into the net.[174][175] The win put the Gunners top of their Europa League group by two points over PSV Eindhoven with a game in hand.[175]

On 9 October, the club played their third consecutive home match of the month against 9th-placed Liverpool,[176] a team that Arsenal had only won one of their last 14 Premier League matches against since the 2015–16 season and had failed to score in their past six meetings with in all competitions.[177][178] The Gunners took the lead after just 58 seconds when captain Ødegaard slipped the ball through three defenders to Martinelli and he tucked the ball home.[179] Liverpool equalised through Darwin Núñez in the 34th minute.[180] At the end of the first half, Arsenal reclaimed the lead, with Saka tucking in Martinelli's low pass through the six-yard box at the back post from a swift counter.[178] Liverpool again got back on terms through substitute Roberto Firmino in the 53rd minute. After Gabriel Jesus was fouled by Thiago inside the box, Saka scored the deciding goal from the penalty spot in the 76th minute, making the score 3–2,[180] and sealing the Gunners' first win over Liverpool since July 2020.[177] This was the fourth time Arsenal had won at least eight of their first nine league matches in a top-flight campaign, after 1947–48, 2004–05 and 2007–08.[179]

Four days later, the Gunners travelled to Bodø, Norway – a town located just north of the Arctic Circle – to face Eliteserien side Bodø/Glimt.[181] The game took place on an artificial pitch at Aspmyra Stadion, where the Norwegian team had won each of their last 14 home matches in European competition.[182][183][184] On 24 minutes, Saka's toe-poked effort was blocked by a defender, the rebound bounced off his face and past the goalkeeper. It was the only goal of the game, and the Gunners won 1–0.[182][183][184]

Arsenal continued their Premier League campaign on 16 October, facing 14th-placed Leeds United away at Elland Road. The game saw goalkeeper Ramsdale produce a man of the match display as the Gunners won 1–0.[185] In a unique start to the game, a power cut outside the stadium after 60 seconds forced a 40-minute suspension,[186] because referee Chris Kavanagh found that he lost communication with VAR, which would play a crucial role when the match eventually resumed.[187] Once they got going again, Saka scored the winning goal from a tight angle in the 35th minute, assisted by Ødegaard.[188] After a VAR check, Leeds were awarded a penalty in the 62nd minute when Saliba was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the box, but striker Patrick Bamford dragged his effort wide of Ramsdale's left-hand post.[186][187][188] In stoppage time, referee Kavanagh sent off defender Gabriel Magalhães for kicking out at Bamford and awarded the hosts a second penalty after discussing with his assistant, but both decisions were overturned after Kavanagh was suggested by VAR to review the incident on the pitchside monitor.[186][187][188] This was the club's best start to a top-flight campaign as the Gunners had won nine of their first ten league games for the first time ever.[188] The result also moved Arsenal four points clear at the top of the Premier League.[186][187]

On 20 October, the Gunners played the postponed Europa League match at home to Dutch side PSV Eindhoven,[189] which finished as runners-up in the 2021–22 Eredivisie. On 70 minutes, Xhaka drove a right-footed effort into the bottom left corner from Tomiyasu's right-wing cross,[190] helping the hosts to a third straight 1–0 victory. The win marked Tierney's 100th appearance for the team,[191] and ensured Arsenal qualified for the Europa League knockout stage with two group games to spare.[192]

On the next day, the club announced that Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Magalhães had signed a new long-term contract.[193][194]

Arsenal headed to the south coast of England on 23 October, facing 14th-placed Southampton at St. Mary's Stadium.[195] In the 11th minute, Xhaka put his side ahead with a right-footed strike from White's cross.[196] But the Gunners were unable to add a second goal, and the hosts found a leveller through Stuart Armstrong on 65 minutes.[197] It ended Arsenal's eight-game winning run, and was also their first draw in 28 Premier League matches since January 2022.[198]

On 27 October, the Gunners travelled to the Netherlands to face Eredivisie side PSV Eindhoven at Philips Stadion.[199] After a tight first-half finished goalless, Joey Veerman and Luuk de Jong both scored one goal in an eight-minute period, sealing a 2–0 win for the hosts, and ending Arsenal's four-game winning run in the Europa League.[200] This was the first time the Gunners suffered an away defeat in the group stage of the Europa League since November 2017.[201][202] The game also saw Martinelli make his 100th appearance for the team in all competitions,[200] and Xhaka make his 50th Europa League appearance, becoming the second Swiss player to reach this milestone.[203]

Arsenal's ninth and last match of the month was against newly promoted Nottingham Forest at home on 30 October.[204] Before the start of the game, the team paid tribute to their on-loan defender Pablo Marí, who was recovering after being stabbed in an Italian supermarket on 27 October.[205][206] The players did the same by holding up a shirt with Mari's name on it after Martinelli opened the scoring with a diving header.[205][207] Before the half hour mark, Saka was forced off with an injury and was replaced by academy graduate Nelson, who netted twice in the early stages of the second half,[208] becoming the first Englishman to score a brace as a substitute for the Gunners in a Premier League game.[207] Partey added the fourth with a long-range strike before an Ødegaard shot made it 5–0.[208][209] The victory was Arsenal's 300th at Emirates Stadium since the club moved from Highbury in 2006.[209] The win also marked Xhaka's 200th Premier League appearance for the team, and kept them on top of the table.[210]

The Gunners' performances in October led to several Premier League monthly award nominations. After leading Arsenal to four wins and a draw from their five Premier League games of the month, Arteta was nominated for Premier League Manager of the Month.[211][212] Xhaka, who scored two goals for the team in October, was shortlisted for Premier League Player of the Month.[213][214] Partey's long-range effort against Tottenham was nominated for the Premier League Goal of the Month award.[215][216] Xhaka was also nominated for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[217] Xhaka was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for October,[218] and Partey's strike against Tottenham was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[219]

November
On 3 November, the Gunners hosted Swiss side Zürich at Emirates Stadium in their final Europa League group game.[220] Gabriel Jesus started as Arsenal's captain for the first time,[220] and Elneny made his return from a hamstring injury after two months out.[110][221] In the 17th minute, Tierney scored the only goal of the game with a left-footed shot from 20 yards to the bottom right corner, helping the team win 1–0.[110][222] The victory meant that the Gunners had finished top of their group in all five of their participations in the UEFA Europa League.[221] This was the first time Arsenal had kept a clean sheet in all three of their home group-stage games in a single European campaign since the 2008–09 season.[221] They would go straight into the Europa League round of 16 in March 2023, skipping the knockout play-off round in February.[110][221]

Arsenal went on to face rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 6 November,[223] a match that saw manager Arteta reach 150 games in all competitions – the same number of appearances he made for the Gunners as a player.[224] Zinchenko was back in the starting line-up after missing nine games with a calf injury.[224][225] Gabriel Magalhães's close-range finish from Saka's corner in the 63rd minute earned the visitors a 1–0 win.[226][227] This was Arteta's 87th victory in charge of Arsenal – more than any of his predecessors, including George Graham and Wenger, over the equivalent period.[224]

Three days later, the Gunners entered the EFL Cup in the third round, facing Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion at home.[228] The 20-year-old Estonia international keeper and academy graduate Karl Hein made his competitive debut for the first team and started in goal,[228][229] becoming the fourth Estonian to start for a Premier League side.[230] Arsenal took the lead through Nketiah's 20th-minute strike after Nelson's run from the halfway line.[231] The Seagulls equalised on 27 minutes courtesy of Danny Welbeck's penalty after Hein slipped and tripped him inside the box.[228] Two counter-attacking goals from Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma and Tariq Lamptey in the second half saw the visitors win 3–1 and end the Gunners' 12-match winning run at home.[231] This was the second time in 20 seasons that Arsenal had failed to progress past the third round of the EFL Cup (formerly League Cup).[229]

On 12 November, Arteta's side played their last game before the 44-day World Cup break against 19th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers away at Molineux Stadium.[232] In the 54th minute, captain Ødegaard tapped Vieira's cross in from close range.[233][234] On 75 minutes, the Norwegian drilled in the rebound after Martinelli's low effort was denied by the goalkeeper, making the score 2–0.[235] The win moved Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League table, the biggest lead they had at the top of the league since December 2013.[233][234] The Gunners would be top on Christmas Day for the first time since 2007.[233][235]

On 18 November, the club appointed Edu Gaspar, a member of "The Invincibles" team of the 2003–04 Arsenal season who re-joined the Gunners as technical director from the Brazilian Football Confederation in July 2019, as their first-ever sporting director.[236][237]

It was reported on 28 November that the first-team players who were not in action for their respective countries were back to London Colney for mid-season friendlies in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and London.[238]

World Cup participants

Saka playing for England at the 2022 FIFA World Cup
The 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December. Ten Arsenal players were named in squads for the tournament: Gabriel Jesus and Martinelli (Brazil),[239][240] Ramsdale, Saka and White (England),[241][242] Saliba (France),[243][244] Partey (Ghana),[245][246] Tomiyasu (Japan),[247][248] Xhaka (as Switzerland's captain),[249][250] and Turner (United States).[251][252]

The group stage of the competition was played from 20 November to 2 December. Six Arsenal players made their World Cup debuts for their respective countries: Saka,[253] Turner,[254] Tomiyasu,[255] Partey,[256] Martinelli,[257] and Saliba.[258]

On 21 November, Saka scored a brace in England's first group game, becoming the youngest player to score more than one goal in his first World Cup game since German Franz Beckenbauer in 1966.[259][260]

Turner, who wore the USA's number one shirt and started in goal during the tournament, kept two clean sheets in three group games, becoming the first US goalkeeper to record multiple clean sheets in one edition of the FIFA World Cup since 1930.[261][262]

On 2 December, Partey saw his World Cup campaign come to an end after Ghana were eliminated at the group stage.[263] The other Arsenal players would remain for the knockout stage which would be played from 3 to 18 December.

However, only Saliba reached the final week of the competition, while the others were eliminated either in the round of 16 or quarter-finals. Saliba's France were defeated in the World Cup final on 18 December.[264]

December
On 4 December, manager Arteta named a 27-man squad – including thirteen academy players – for the trip to the United Arab Emirates, where they would play two friendlies in the Dubai Super Cup.[265]

Two days later, Arsenal confirmed that striker Gabriel Jesus had undergone surgery to his right knee after suffering an injury during Brazil's World Cup group stage match against Cameroon on 2 December. The club did not give any timescale on his return.[266][267]

The Gunners faced Ligue 1 side Lyon at Al Maktoum Stadium in Dubai on 8 December. Gabriel Magalhães, Nketiah and Vieira each scored one goal in the first half, helping the team win 3–0. The friendly also featured a post-match penalty shootout and Arsenal earned an extra point by edging that 2–1, with young goalkeeper Karl Hein making four saves out of five.[268]

Arteta's side played their second and final game of the Dubai tour against Serie A side Milan at Al Maktoum Stadium on 13 December. The Gunners won 2–1 with Ødegaard scoring the opener and Nelson scoring the second. Hein made a save in the post-match penalty shootout as Arsenal triumphed 4–3 and earned a bonus point. This ensured that the Gunners claimed the Dubai Super Cup with eight points.[269]

After flying back to England, Arsenal hosted Serie A side Juventus for their final friendly during the World Cup break at Emirates Stadium on 17 December. A Xhaka own goal and a strike from Samuel Iling-Junior snatched victory for the Italian team. The game also saw Nelson limp off with a muscle injury in the 22nd minute.[270]

The Gunners' first action after the World Cup was a Boxing Day fixture at home against 16th-placed West Ham United and former Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański.[271] The Hammers took the lead on 27 minutes when Jarrod Bowen was judged to have been fouled inside the box by Saliba, allowing Saïd Benrahma to smash a penalty down the middle.[272] Arteta's side were awarded a penalty for handball in first-half stoppage time, but the decision was overturned after referee Michael Oliver checked the pitchside monitor.[273] In the 53rd minute, Saka scored the equaliser from close range after collecting Ødegaard's scuffed shot.[274] Just five minutes later, Martinelli fired a low left-footed shot past Fabiański from a narrow angle, assisted by Xhaka.[273] On 69 minutes, Ødegaard's pass picked out Nketiah, who led the line in the absence of the injured Gabriel Jesus, and the striker spun in the box before shooting into the bottom left corner.[274] The 3–1 win marked the three-year anniversary of Arteta's first game as Arsenal manager.[272] Former Gunners boss Wenger, who spent 22 years in north London, returned to Emirates Stadium for the first time since leaving the club in May 2018. He watched the game from the directors' box and heard his name sang by the home crowd.[272][273][274]

On New Year's Eve, Arsenal travelled to the south coast of England to play their final game of 2022 – also the last Premier League fixture of the year – against 7th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion,[275] who knocked them out of the EFL Cup via a 3–1 victory at Emirates Stadium in November. Before kick-off, there was a minute's applause in tribute to Brazilian football legend Pelé, who died on 29 December, at the age of 82.[276][277] After just 66 seconds, Saka latched onto a rebound from Martinelli's shot to tuck the ball home.[278] It was Arsenal's earliest away goal in the Premier League since May 2013, when Theo Walcott scored after 20 seconds versus Queens Park Rangers.[279] In the 39th minute, skipper Ødegaard put his side 2–0 ahead with a curled shot from the centre of the box to the bottom right corner.[280] On 47 minutes, Nketiah poked the ball in from close range after Brighton's goalkeeper Robert Sánchez spilled Martinelli's shot from a tight angle.[278] In the 65th minute, Kaoru Mitoma pulled one back and reduced the deficit for the Seagulls.[279] Just 6 minutes later, Ødegaard whipped a pass into space for Martinelli to race through and fire between Sánchez's legs to score a goal, restoring the three-goal advantage for the Gunners.[280] On 77 minutes, Saliba was casual on the edge of his own box, allowing Evan Ferguson his chance to pull another goal back.[278] Brighton's Mitoma looked to have scored again with stoppage-time to come, but the goal was ruled out by VAR for offside in the build-up.[279] The 4–2 victory took Arsenal seven points clear at the top of the Premier League.[278] They became the fifth team in English top-flight history to pick up as many as 43 points from the first 16 games in a season.[279]

The Gunners' performances in November and December led to several Premier League monthly award nominations. After guiding Arsenal to four wins from four Premier League games either side of the World Cup, Arteta picked up his second Premier League Manager of the Month award of the campaign, winning the award for the fourth time since December 2019.[281][282] Ødegaard and Saka were shortlisted for Premier League Player of the Month,[283][284] which was won by Ødegaard. He became the first Arsenal player to win the award since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in September 2019.[285][286] It was also the first time since March 2015 the club scooped both awards, when manager Arsène Wenger and striker Olivier Giroud were the recipients.[282] Nketiah's strike against West Ham United was nominated for the Premier League Goal of the Month award.[287][288] Ødegaard and Saka were also nominated for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[289] White and Saka were voted as the club's Player of the Month for November and December, respectively.[290][291] Nketiah's strike against West Ham United was voted as December's Arsenal Goal of the Month.[292]

January
Arteta's side would face a tough January before reaching the Premier League campaign's midpoint, with 5th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and 4th-placed Manchester United to follow after 3rd-placed Newcastle United.

Arsenal started 2023 with a home game against Newcastle on 3 January,[293] hoping to extend their lead at the top of the table. However, neither team was able to break the deadlock and the game finished 0–0.[294][295][296] This was the first time the Gunners failed to score in a Premier League match since May 2022.[294] It was also the first time they failed to win at home in the Premier League since April 2022.[295]

On 9 January, the Gunners entered the FA Cup in the third round, facing League One side Oxford United away at Kassam Stadium.[297] In the 63rd minute, Elneny opened the scoring with a header from Vieira's free-kick.[298] On 70 minutes, Vieira claimed another assist when he threaded a pass into the path of Nketiah, who raced through the backline, rounded the goalkeeper and slid the ball home.[299] In the 75th minute, Smith Rowe came off the bench to make his first appearance since September following groin surgery.[298] A minute later, Nketiah added his second goal of the night with a chip over the keeper from Martinelli's pass.[297] The 3–0 result advanced them to the next round, in which they were drawn away to Manchester City on the final weekend of January.[299]

Two days later, the club unveiled eight new pieces of artwork that would adorn the exterior of Emirates Stadium: Victoria Concordia Crescit, Remember Who You Are, Invincible, Come To See The Arsenal, Eighteen Eighty-Six, We All Follow The Arsenal, Future Brilliance, and Found a Place Where We Belong.[300][301][302]

On 15 January, Arsenal faced rivals Tottenham at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the second North London derby of the season.[303] In the 14th minute, Saka's cross was deflected home by Spurs goalkeeper Lloris.[304] On 36 minutes, Ødegaard doubled Arsenal's lead with a long-range strike assisted by Saka.[305] Spurs did create chances and moments of anxiety for the visitors, especially in the second half; but they could not find a way past Arsenal keeper Ramsdale, who produced a man of the match display with seven saves, including a vital stop with his foot to deny Ryan Sessegnon on 52 minutes, helping his side record the first clean sheet in North London derbies since Arteta took charge of Arsenal in December 2019.[306] The 2–0 win was the Gunners' first Premier League victory at Spurs' stadium since March 2014, and secured their first league double over Tottenham since the 2013–14 season.[305][306] The result moved Arsenal eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.[304]

An incident occurred at the final whistle after the Gunners won away at their nearest rivals. Live television footage showed keeper Ramsdale went to retrieve his water bottle when a Spurs supporter jumped onto the advertising hoarding behind the goal and kicked the England international in the back.[307][308][309] Ramsdale was led away from the area after the Spurs fan scurried away through the stands.[307][308] "Violence towards players is completely unacceptable," the Professional Footballers' Association said in a statement. "Players have a right to be safe in their place of work. When a player is attacked, we expect the laws and regulations that are in place to protect players to be properly enforced."[310] England's national governing body, the Football Association, said they "strongly condemn" the incident of "wholly unacceptable behaviour".[311] A statement from the Premier League said: "There is no place in football for acts of violence, and under no circumstance should players be attacked or fear for their safety at games."[312] On 17 January, the Metropolitan Police said a man was charged after the incident.[313][314][315][316] A month later, a 35-year-old man from East London pleaded guilty at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court in West London to assault by beating, going onto an area adjacent to the playing area and throwing a missile onto a football playing area.[317][318][319] The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: "He was sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid work, £100 compensation to the victim, costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £114. He would also be subject to a four-year football banning order."[320]

On 22 January, Arsenal played at home to rivals Manchester United,[321] the only team that had beaten them in the Premier League this season so far. The Gunners' first-choice centre-back pairing Gabriel Magalhães and Saliba, and winger Saka were treading a disciplinary tightrope, because they had each received four bookings of the Premier League season before this game. A booking in this match would rule them out for the upcoming league game. The suspension threshold would rise to ten bookings after this game.[322] New signing Leandro Trossard was among the substitutes after completing his transfer;[323] and new recruit Jakub Kiwior was present at Emirates Stadium, even though his arrival at the club was not yet announced.[324] In the 17th minute, Rashford gave United the lead with a long-range strike.[325] Seven minutes later, the Gunners levelled through Nketiah, whose header from Xhaka's cross made it 18 goals in his last 26 starts for the club.[323] On 53 minutes, Saka cut in from the right and arrowed a long-range screamer across goalkeeper David de Gea into the far corner of the net,[326] becoming the third Arsenal player to have scored in three Premier League games in a row against Manchester United, after Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry.[322] But the visitors were back on level terms six minutes later as Lisandro Martínez looped a header into the net.[325] As the game entered the final ten minutes, the Gunners kept putting United under pressure. Trossard came on for his debut to bolster the attack, and was involved in the 90th-minute winner.[326] After the ball bounced around in the area, it fell to Nketiah who poked home from close range and sent the Emirates crowd into raptures.[323][325] This was Nketiah's 13th goal in his last 13 starts at Emirates Stadium,[326] making him the first Arsenal player to score two goals in a Premier League game against United since Alexis Sánchez in October 2015.[323] The 3–2 victory extended the Gunners' unbeaten home record against United to five league games and league record this season to 13 matches,[323] and put them a five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League with a game in hand.[325] Arsenal had 50 points from 19 games at the halfway stage of the league season – their best start to a top-flight campaign – 15 more than they had at the same stage last season.[327][328]

The Gunners headed to Manchester City on 27 January for their first meeting of the season with Guardiola's side at Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup fourth round.[329] New recruit Trossard was handed his first Arsenal start, and Kiwior was named on the bench following his signing with the club earlier in the week.[329] In the 64th minute, Nathan Aké scored the only goal of the tight game with a low shot, helping the hosts win 1–0.[330] The defeat meant that Arteta's side had exited the EFL Cup and FA Cup in the early stages, and would concentrate on the Premier League, as well as the Europa League, which would return in March.[331]

On 31 January, the club announced that midfielder Elneny had undergone surgery to his right knee after suffering a significant injury in a training session. He would be out for an extended period of time.[332][333]

Arsenal's performances in January led to several Premier League monthly award nominations. After leading the Gunners to two wins and a draw from their Premier League games against three teams vying for a place in the top four, Arteta was named Premier League Manager of the Month for the third time this season – the fifth time since December 2019.[334][335] He was the first manager to win the award in successive months since Manchester City's Guardiola did so in November and December 2021. Arteta also became the first Arsenal manager to win the award three times in a single campaign, which was the first time that had happened in the league since Liverpool's Klopp won five in the 2019–20 season.[334][335] Saka was shortlisted for Premier League Player of the Month,[336][337] and his long-range screamer against Manchester United was nominated for the Premier League Goal of the Month award.[338][339] Ramsdale's vital save to deny Tottenham's Ryan Sessegnon was included on the shortlist for Premier League Save of the Month,[340] making him the first Arsenal goalkeeper to be nominated for the award since its inception during the 2022–23 season.[341] Saka was also shortlisted for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[342] Zinchenko was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for January,[343] and Saka's strike against Manchester United was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[344]

First-team transfers (winter transfer window)

Trossard playing for Brighton & Hove Albion in 2022
On 16 January, the club confirmed English goalkeeper and academy graduate Arthur Okonkwo was recalled from his loan at League Two side Crewe Alexandra and joined Austrian Bundesliga side Sturm Graz on loan for the remainder of the season.[345]

Arsenal announced their first signing of the winter transfer window on 20 January with 28-year-old Belgian forward Leandro Trossard joining the club on a long-term contract from fellow Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion. He would wear the number 19 shirt.[346][347] With the ability to play in several attacking positions, Trossard scored seven goals in sixteen Premier League games for Brighton this season. He also made three appearances for Belgium at the 2022 World Cup.[346][347]

On 23 January, the club confirmed that they had signed 22-year-old Polish defender Jakub Kiwior from Serie A side Spezia. He would wear the number 15 shirt.[348][349] A versatile defender, Kiwior was capable of playing both as a centre-back and as a defensive midfielder during his time with the Italian side.[350][351][352] As of December 2022, he had won nine caps for Poland and started all four of their matches at the 2022 World Cup.[348][349]


Jorginho with Chelsea in 2019
On transfer deadline day, 31 January, the Gunners announced that 31-year-old Italian midfielder Jorginho had joined the club from Premier League side Chelsea and would wear the number 20 shirt.[353][354] Jorginho had made 143 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, winning the UEFA Europa League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup during his time at the club. Capped 46 times, he was part of the Italy squad which won UEFA Euro 2020.[353][354] In 2021, he was named UEFA Men's Player of the Year and placed third in the Ballon d'Or.[355][356]

The departures of two first-team players were announced on the same day, as Brazilian forward Marquinhos joined EFL Championship side Norwich City on loan for the remainder of the season,[357] and Belgian midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga joined fellow Premier League side Crystal Palace on loan until June 2023.[358]

On 1 February, Arsenal confirmed that Portuguese defender Cédric Soares had joined Premier League side Fulham on loan until the end of the 2022–23 season.[359]

After the winter transfer window closed, there were twenty-four players in the first-team squad: three goalkeepers, eight defenders, seven midfielders, and six forwards.[360]

February
On 3 February, the club announced that Brazilian forward Martinelli had penned a new long-term contract.[361][362]

Arteta's side continued their Premier League campaign on 4 February with an away game against 19th-placed Everton,[363] a team that appointed Sean Dyche as their new manager five days ago.[364][365] This was the first time the Gunners named the same starting XI in five consecutive league games since May 2015.[366] In the 59th minute, deadline-day signing Jorginho made his debut for the team as a substitute.[364] Just a minute later, James Tarkowski netted the only goal of the match to clinch victory for the hosts.[366] This was Arsenal's second Premier League defeat of the season and their first in the last 14 games.[365] Despite the loss, the Gunners remained top of the table by five points with a game in hand.[367]

On Saturday, 11 February, Arsenal played at home against 7th-placed Brentford.[368] With the game still goalless on the hour mark, manager Arteta turned to his bench, bringing on winter signing Trossard.[369] Within five minutes the Belgian forward converted a low Saka cross at the far post, netting his first goal for the club.[370] In the 74th minute, Ivan Toney nodded in Christian Nørgaard's cross from close range for the visitors.[371] The goal was eventually awarded by the video assistant referee Lee Mason after he spent two minutes 26 seconds checking[372][373] whether Brentford's Ethan Pinnock had blocked Gabriel Magalhães from Mathias Jensen's free-kick when in an offside position.[374][375][376] However, Mason failed to identify Brentford's Nørgaard, who assisted the goal, was offside before making the crucial cross for Toney to score, and it later emerged that no lines had been drawn to check for a possible offside.[377][375][378] The Gunners had to try to break down the Brentford defensive block once again, but they couldn't find a way through.[369] This was the first time Arsenal failed to win a Premier League home game in which they scored first since 1 January 2022.[370] The 1–1 draw left them to settle for a three-point advantage over Manchester City with a game in hand. In the post-match presser, Arteta said, "different rules" were applied for Toney's Brentford equaliser.[379][380] On the same day, Brighton & Hove Albion had a goal incorrectly ruled out for offside in their draw at Crystal Palace, because the offside line was wrongly drawn by the video assistant referee.[377][381][382]

On Sunday, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) – the body responsible for match officials in English professional football – said in a statement:[381][383][384] "PGMOL can confirm its Chief Refereeing Officer Howard Webb has contacted both Arsenal and Brighton & Hove Albion to acknowledge and explain the significant errors in the VAR process in their respective Premier League fixtures on Saturday. Both incidents, which were due to human error and related to the analysis of offside situations, are being thoroughly reviewed by PGMOL."[385][386] It was not the first time a controversial VAR call had contributed towards the Gunners dropping points this season. In fact, it had happened on four separate occasions so far:[374] Martinelli's goal was disallowed after VAR check at Manchester United on 4 September;[134][135] Gabriel Jesus was denied a penalty at Southampton on 23 October; at least one penalty was denied at the Emirates against Newcastle United on 3 January; and Ivan Toney's Brentford goal stood after VAR check on 11 February.[374] PGMOL confirmed on 17 February that Lee Mason had left the organisation by mutual consent.[387][388][373]

On 15 February, Arteta's side played the postponed Premier League match at home to 2nd-placed and reigning champions Manchester City.[389] Gabriel Magalhães made his 100th appearance for the club in all competitions, and new recruit Jorginho got his full debut as he replaced Partey, who had suffered a muscular injury before this game.[390] In the 24th minute, Tomiyasu left his backpass short for goalkeeper Ramsdale, allowing City's Kevin De Bruyne to nip in and lob the ball into an unguarded net.[391] The Gunners drew level on 42 minutes through a Saka penalty after City goalkeeper Ederson fouled Nketiah inside the box.[392] Guardiola's side were also awarded a penalty on 57 minutes, but the decision was overturned for offside by VAR.[393] In the 72nd minute, a loose pass by Gabriel Magalhães was hoovered up by City, and they rapidly worked the ball out to Jack Grealish, whose low shot took a deflection off Tomiyasu on its way into the net.[391] The visitors added a third on 82 minutes when Erling Haaland fired a low finish into the far corner.[392] The 1–3 defeat saw Arsenal's unbeaten home record come to an end after 14 league games,[394] and meant that the Gunners had lost their last 11 Premier League games against Manchester City since the 2017–18 season, their longest losing run against an opponent in their league history.[393] After the match, Arsenal swapped places with City at the top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand.[392]

The Gunners travelled to Villa Park on 18 February to play against 11th-placed Aston Villa,[395] managed by former Arsenal boss Unai Emery, who took charge of the team in November 2022,[396] and was facing his former club for the first time in the Premier League. In a six-goal thriller Arteta's side twice came from behind to win the match, while scoring twice in the stoppage time.[397][398] On five minutes, Ollie Watkins put the hosts ahead with a counter-attacking goal. In the 16th minute, White's cross from the right was half cleared, and Saka smashed the bouncing ball into the net beyond former Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.[399] Fifteen minutes later, Villa restored the lead through Philippe Coutinho's strike.[397] On the hour, Zinchenko collected an Ødegaard pass in space outside the box and fired in at the near post for his first Arsenal goal[399] – indeed his first Premier League goal from 92 games in six seasons.[398] In the 82nd minute, Ramsdale made a vital save to keep Arsenal in the game by tipping of recently subbed in, Leon Bailey's effort on to the bar.[398] In stoppage time, Jorginho's long-range shot came off the crossbar and bounced in off goalkeeper Martínez's head to put the Gunners ahead.[398] Martínez then went up the other end for a late Villa corner, and was caught out on the break when Arsenal cleared to Vieira who released Martinelli to walk it home.[398][399] The dramatic 4–2 victory ended the Gunners' run of three Premier League games without a win, and took them two points clear at the top of the league with a game in hand.[398]

On 21 February, Arsenal confirmed that Egyptian midfielder Elneny, who underwent surgery to his right knee in January,[332][333] had extended his contract with the club until June 2024.[400][401]

The Gunners' last match of the month was against 14th-placed Leicester City at King Power Stadium on 25 February.[402] Zinchenko started as Arsenal's captain for the first time as a mark of respect in the week of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of his homeland Ukraine;[403] and Trossard led the line as a false nine, because Nketiah had picked up a knock before the game and Gabriel Jesus continued his recovery from injury.[404] On 26 minutes, Saka's corner was punched away by Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward, and Xhaka collected the ball and played a pass to Trossard who curled a shot from outside the box into the top corner.[405] However, the goal was disallowed by referee Craig Pawson following a VAR review for a foul on keeper Ward by White.[403] In the opening minute of the second half, Trossard pulled wide and fed a nutmeg pass to Martinelli who bursted into the box and stroked the ball into the far corner.[404] This was the 200th goal the Gunners had scored in the Premier League under Arteta.[406] The 1–0 win was Arsenal's 10th away win in the Premier League this season – the fastest they had reached 10 away victories in any league campaign in their history (13 matches) – more than in the whole of last season.[405][406] Goalkeeper Ramsdale recorded his eighth clean sheet in a Premier League away game this season, the most by any Arsenal keeper since Jens Lehmann had kept eight in the unbeaten 2003–04 season.[406] After the game, Arteta said, "Today we wanted to win for him [Zinchenko], for his loved ones, and for all the Ukrainian people that I think has inspired the world with that fighting spirit and with the togetherness they showed as a country. If we can add some happiness today to them and reflecting on who Alex [Zinchenko] is for us, it was a good opportunity, so I'm delighted to dedicate that win to them."[407]

Though Arteta's side wobbled in February, some players were still recognised with monthly award nominations. Ramsdale's vital save to deny Aston Villa's Leon Bailey was shortlisted for February's Premier League Save of the Month,[408][409] making him the first Arsenal goalkeeper to be nominated for the award in successive months since its inception during the 2022–23 season. Saka was nominated for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[410] Zinchenko was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for February,[411] and his strike against Aston Villa was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[412]

March
On 1 March, the Gunners played the postponed Premier League match at home to 18th-placed Everton,[413] who beat them 1–0 at Goodison Park just over three weeks ago. Five minutes before half-time, Zinchenko – a left-back only in name in this game – provided a through ball from the right-hand side of midfield to Saka who spun past Everton's defender and fired a right-footed shot past his international colleague Jordan Pickford from a narrow angle.[414][415] The goal was Saka's 50th goal involvement (goal or assist) in the Premier League. At 21 years and 177 days, he became the sixth-youngest player to reach the milestone in the competition,[414][415] and the youngest Arsenal player since Cesc Fàbregas achieved it in April 2008.[416][417] Saka also became the first Arsenal player – the eighth player in Premier League history – to score 10 or more goals in multiple Premier League seasons before turning 22.[417] In first-half stoppage time, Everton's Idrissa Gueye was caught dawdling on the ball, Saka nicked it off his toe and immediately played in Martinelli who raced through and slotted the ball past Pickford.[418] The goal was initially ruled out for offside by the linesman's flag, but the decision was overturned after a VAR check.[414][418] This meant that both Saka and Martinelli netted their 10th Premier League goals of the season, and Arsenal became the first team to have two players reach double figures for goals this campaign.[414][417] The Gunners added a third on 71 minutes when Ødegaard tucked home a Trossard cutback.[418] In the 80th minute, Martinelli scored his second goal of the night by tapping Nketiah's cross in from close range.[418] Ramsdale made a double save in second-half stoppage time, helping the hosts win 4–0.[414] This was Arsenal's 100th league victory against Everton, making the Gunners the first team in English league history to register 100 wins against a specific opponent.[414][415] The result moved them five points clear at the top of the Premier League, and ensured it was the third time the club had picked up at least 60 points from the first 25 games in a single Premier League campaign, after 2003–04 and 2007–08.[419][420]

Three days later, Arteta's side played at home against 19th-placed Bournemouth,[421] a match that saw the Gunners fall behind after just nine seconds and come back from two goals down with half an hour left to beat the Cherries 3–2 with a stunning 97th-minute winner from substitute Nelson.[422][423][424] Vieira made his second Premier League start for the club after replacing Xhaka;[423] and this was the first time since January 1986 that Arsenal named a starting line-up without a single player to have made a competitive appearance under Wenger, who was in charge of the Gunners from 1996 to 2018.[425][426] Bournemouth took a surprise lead after just 9.11 seconds through Philip Billing from a preconceived kick-off routine.[423][427] It was the second-quickest goal scored in the Premier League era.[422] In the 20th minute, Ramsdale made a vital save to deny Dango Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.[422] Two minutes later, Trossard was forced off with an injury and was replaced by academy graduate Smith Rowe.[428] This meant that Arsenal's first three centre-forwards – Gabriel Jesus, Nketiah and Trossard – were all injured at the moment, and Martinelli had to play up top, in a role he had never been in this season.[423] On 57 minutes, the hosts fell further behind to Marcos Senesi's header from a corner.[422] In the 62nd minute, A Saka corner was cleared to Smith Rowe, and he headed back into the six-yard box for Partey to tap home at the back post.[423] On 69 minutes, academy graduate Nelson made his third Premier League appearance of the season as he came off the bench to replace Smith Rowe.[427][429] Just a minute later, Nelson sent in a curling cross for defender White, who drove it goalwards and over the line before Bournemouth keeper Neto pushed it away, with the goal-line technology confirming the ball had completely crossed the line.[422] It was White's first Arsenal goal since he joined the club in 2021 and his first Premier League goal from 94 games.[428] With referee Chris Kavanagh set to blow the final whistle in the 7th minute of stoppage time, an Ødegaard corner was cleared as far as Nelson, who chested it down and smashed a left-footed shot through a crowd of bodies and past visiting goalkeeper.[422][423][424] The goal sparked bedlam on the pitch and the Arsenal bench, and sent Emirates Stadium into ecstasy.[430][429][428] Nelson's last-gasp stunner (96:57) was the Gunners' second-latest 90th-minute winner on record in the Premier League (since 2006–07), after Alexis Sánchez's penalty against Burnley in January 2017 (97:14).[423] Arteta's side had netted three 90th-minute winners in the Premier League this campaign, the joint-most 90th-minute winners Arsenal had scored in a single season in the competition.[428] This was the first time in Premier League history that a team scored a 90th-minute winning goal after having gone behind in the first minute since August 2007.[431] It was also the first time the Gunners had won a Premier League game in which they trailed by two or more goals since February 2012.[423]

On 9 March, Arsenal travelled to Lisbon, Portugal to face Sporting CP in the Europa League last-16 first leg.[432] Winter signing Kiwior made his debut for the first team in a 2–2 draw.[433] The Gunners took the lead in the 22nd minute when Saliba headed home from Vieira's corner.[434] Twelve minutes later, the hosts levelled in almost identical fashion when Gonçalo Inácio nodded in from a corner.[435] On 55 minutes, Paulinho tapped in from close range to put Sporting ahead.[434] Arsenal equalised in the 62nd minute when Xhaka's attempted through ball deflected off Hidemasa Morita and into his own net.[435] The result ensured the Gunners would start on level terms when the two teams meet in the return leg at Emirates Stadium On 16 March.[433]

Arteta's side continued their Premier League campaign on 12 March, facing 7th-placed Fulham and former Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno away at Craven Cottage.[436] Trossard started as a false nine, and Gabriel Jesus was included in the Gunners' matchday squad for the first time since November 2022 following his knee injury.[437] In the 16th minute, Martinelli's shot was parried by Leno into Antonee Robinson, and the ball ended up in the back of the Fulham net.[438] But after a VAR check, the goal was ruled out for offside in the build-up.[439] Gabriel Magalhães opened the scoring on 21 minutes with a header from Trossard's corner.[437] Arteta's side doubled the lead with a counter-attacking goal in the 26th minute when Xhaka took Saliba's sweeping pass from Arsenal's penalty area, dribbled the ball forward a few paces and fed it to Trossard, who crossed for Martinelli to head home at the far post.[438] The Gunners added a third in first-half stoppage time as Ødegaard tucked home from Trossard's chip,[439] making him the first player in Premier League history to assist three goals in the first half of an away game.[437][440] On 77 minutes, Gabriel Jesus made his first Arsenal appearance in four months to replace Trossard.[438] The 3–0 win was Arteta's 100th victory in all competitions as Gunners boss (including two wins that were secured on penalty shootout),[438][441] making him the ninth Arsenal manager to reach the milestone,[442] and ensuring the Gunners became the first team in English Football League history to win five consecutive London derbies away from home without conceding a single goal.[443][444] Arteta's side had won 27 matches in all competitions so far this season, already more than in the whole of the last campaign.[442]

Arsenal's fine form during the season was recognised at the 2023 London Football Awards, which took place on 13 March. Ødegaard picked up the Premier League Player of the Year award, Saka won the Men's Young Player of the Year award, Ramsdale received the Goalkeeper of the Year award, and Arteta was named Manager of the Year.[445][446][447]

On 15 March, the club announced that Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke and his son Josh Kroenke had been appointed as co-chairs whilst Tim Lewis had become executive vice-chair in a boardroom restructure.[1][2]

A week after the first leg of the Europa League round of 16 match, the Gunners hosted Sporting CP in the second leg on 16 March.[448] In the 7th minute, Tomiyasu limped off with a injury and was replaced by White.[449] On 19 minutes, Xhaka tucked in the rebound from Martinelli's shot to put Arsenal ahead.[450] Two minutes later, Saliba was also withdrawn to be replaced by Holding.[451] Pedro Gonçalves levelled for the visitors on 62 minutes with a stunning 46-yard chip from just inside the Gunners' half, catching goalkeeper Ramsdale off his line.[450][451] There were no further goals in regular time and with the away goals rule no longer applying after the 2020–21 UEFA season,[452] both teams headed for the extra thirty minutes.[449] Arsenal had several chances to score in extra-time, but the Portuguese side held out to force the game to penalties, despite Manuel Ugarte receiving a second yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Saka late on.[451] Ødegaard, Saka and Trossard all scored from the penalty spot, but Martinelli's effort was saved by visiting goalkeeper Antonio Adán, and Nuno Santos lashed into the net past Ramsdale to seal a 5–3 win on penalties for Sporting.[450] This was the first penalty shootout the Gunners had competed in at Emirates Stadium, and their 23rd overall in all competitions.[450] The result meant that Arteta's side had exited the Europa League, and domestic league football would be their sole focus for the rest of the season.[449]

Ahead of the last international break of the season, the Gunners played at home on 19 March against 12th-placed Crystal Palace,[453] who sacked manager and former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira two days ago.[454] Holding made his first Premier League start of the season after replacing injured Saliba in the Europa League last-16 second leg match.[455] Martinelli opened the scoring on 28 minutes with a left-footed strike – his sixth goal in six Premier League games – from Saka's right-footed cross,[456] making Saka the first player to reach double figures for both goals and assists in the Premier League this campaign, and the first Arsenal player to do so since Alexis Sánchez in 2016–17.[455] In the 43rd minute, White fed a pass to Saka who fired a low shot past teenage goalkeeper Joe Whitworth.[454] Xhaka made it three for the hosts on 55 minutes with a close-range finish from Trossard's assist.[456] Eight minutes later, Palace's Jeffrey Schlupp pulled one back from close range following a corner.[454] Saka restored Arsenal's three-goal advantage on 74 minutes with a strike from substitute Tierney's pull-back.[455] In the 86th minute, Kiwior made his home and Premier League debut as a substitute.[453] The 4–1 victory extended the Gunners' winning streak to six in the Premier League for the first time this season, and put them an eight-point advantage over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League with City having a game in hand.[454] Arteta's side had won 22 Premier League games so far this season – Arsenal's most-ever wins in their first 28 matches of a league campaign – as many as they managed in the whole of last term.[455] With 10 league games to go, the Gunners had notched up 69 points to reach their same points tally as last season.[457] This was the first time since 2004 that the club had won four consecutive Premier League matches by scoring at least three goals in each of them.[456] The Gunners became the first side in English Football League history to win nine London derbies in a single league campaign.[458]

On 21 March, Arsenal confirmed that defender Tomiyasu, who had suffered a significant injury in the match against Sporting five days ago, had undergone surgery to his right knee. He became the fourth Arsenal first-team player to undergo surgery after suffering an injury in this season, after Smith Rowe, Gabriel Jesus, and Elneny. Tomiyasu would miss the rest of the season.[459][460]

Twelve Arsenal first-team players (excluding players who were loaned out) were named in their respective countries' senior squads for international fixtures in March: Trossard (Belgium), Ramsdale and Saka (England), Hein (Estonia), Partey (Ghana), Jorginho (Italy), Ødegaard (as Norway's captain), Kiwior (Poland), Tierney (Scotland), Xhaka (as Switzerland's captain), Zinchenko (as Ukraine's captain), and Turner (United States).[461]

The Gunners' performances in March led to several Premier League monthly award nominations. After leading Arsenal to four wins from four Premier League games, Arteta picked up his fourth Premier League Manager of the Month award of the season,[462] becoming the third manager in Premier League history to do so in a single campaign, after Guardiola in 2017–18 and Klopp in 2019–20.[463] Arteta had won the award six times since he took charge of the Gunners in December 2019 – the joint-ninth in the all-time standings.[464] Saka and Trossard were shortlisted for Premier League Player of the Month,[465][466] which was won by Saka for the first time in his career.[467][468] Nelson's last-gasp strike against Bournemouth was nominated for the Premier League Goal of the Month award.[469][470] Ramsdale's vital save to deny Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara won the Premier League Save of the Month award, making him the first Arsenal goalkeeper to claim the award since its inception during the 2022–23 season.[471][472] Martinelli and Saka were included on the shortlist for the PFA Premier League Fans' Player of the Month award.[473] Trossard was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for March,[474] and Nelson's strike against Bournemouth was voted as the club's Goal of the Month.[475]

April
Arteta's side returned to action after the international break with a game against 14th-placed Leeds United at home on 1 April.[476] Before kick-off, both teams paid tribute to former Arsenal and Leeds player David Rocastle, who passed away on 31 March 2001, aged 33.[477] The Gunners took the lead in the 35th minute as Gabriel Jesus was tripped by Luke Ayling inside the box, and the Brazilian tucked the ball down the middle from 12 yards to register his first Arsenal goal since 1 October.[478] The hosts doubled their lead on 47 minutes when Martinelli's low cross found the former Leeds defender White, who rushed forwards and crashed his effort into the net from close range.[479] Eight minutes later, Gabriel Jesus netted his second goal of the afternoon by poking in Trossard's cross.[477] In the 76th minute, Rasmus Kristensen pulled one back for the visitors via a deflection off Zinchenko.[478] Xhaka restored the Gunners' three-goal lead on 84 minutes with a header from Ødegaard's delivery, making the score 4–1.[479] The victory was Arteta's 100th victory in all competitions as Arsenal manager (excluding two wins that were secured on penalty shootout).[477] This was the first time the Gunners had recorded seven straight Premier League wins under the Spaniard.[479] It was also the first time Arsenal had won three consecutive league games by a margin of three or more goals since October 2015.[478]

The Gunners headed to Anfield to take on Liverpool on 9 April.[480] In the 8th minute, Saka attempted to swap passes with Ødegaard, but the return ball came off Virgil van Dijk and into the path of Martinelli, who prodded home past goalkeeper Alisson to put the visitors ahead.[481] It was Martinelli's 25th goal in the Premier League, making him the second South American player – along with teammate Gabriel Jesus – to score 25 or more goals in the competition before turning 22.[481] Martinelli added an assist on 28 minutes with a delivery for Gabriel Jesus to head home.[482] The hosts pulled one back through Mohamed Salah on 42 minutes.[483] Klopp's side were awarded a penalty by referee Paul Tierney in the 52nd minute when Holding was deemed to have brought down Diogo Jota inside the box, but Salah dragged his effort wide of Ramsdale's right-hand post.[482] Ramsdale made a vital stop to deny Núñez on 81 minutes when the Liverpool's forward was through on goal.[483] In the 87th minute, Firmino nodded in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross from close range for Liverpool.[481] In stoppage time, Ramsdale produced a flying fingertip save to deny Salah's deflected curling shot, then kept out Ibrahima Konaté's effort from point-blank range.[483] The 2–2 draw meant that Arsenal remained winless in ten visits to Anfield in the Premier League since 2012, and the Gunners' seven-game winning run in the Premier League came to an end.[482] Arsenal's lead at the top of the league was cut to six points over Manchester City who still had a game in hand.[483]

On 16 April, Arteta's side crossed the capital to face 14th-placed West Ham United at London Stadium.[484] Tierney made his first Premier League start in 2023 as he replaced Zinchenko who had suffered a tight groin before this game.[485] In the 7th minute, Gabriel Jesus scored his fourth goal in three matches by tapping White's low cross in from close range.[486] Three minutes later, Martinelli crossed for Ødegaard at the back post to volley in a second.[487] After Partey lost possession on the edge of his own box to Declan Rice and Gabriel Magalhães brought Lucas Paquetá down inside the box, Benrahma pulled one back for the Hammers from the penalty spot on 33 minutes.[488] Arsenal were awarded a penalty themselves in the 50th minute for Michail Antonio's handball, but Saka side-footed his effort wide of the left-hand post.[486] The hosts equalised on 54 minutes through Bowen's finish.[487] This was the first time the Gunners had given up a two-goal lead in consecutive Premier League games.[489] The 2–2 draw left Arsenal four points clear at the top of the Premier League, having played one game more.[488]

Five days later, the Gunners played at home against 20th-placed Southampton.[490] White and Zinchenko both made their 100th Premier League appearances,[491] and Vieira replaced Xhaka who missed the game through illness.[492] Saints took a surprise lead after just 28 seconds, when Ramsdale attempted a short pass to Zinchenko who was near the penalty arc as two Southampton players – Carlos Alcaraz and Theo Walcott – converged in an co-ordinated press, but the Arsenal keeper didn't spot Alcaraz, and the latter pounced and fired the ball into the bottom corner.[492][493] This meant that Arteta's side had conceded the two fastest goals at Emirates Stadium in the Premier League this campaign, the other being Philip Billing's strike after 9.11 seconds for Bournemouth on 4 March.[492] The visitors doubled their advantage in the 14th minute as Walcott haunted his former club with a low finish.[494] Zinchenko then tried to rally his teammates by calling an inquest among all 11 Arsenal players in the centre circle.[492] Martinelli got one back for the Gunners on 20 minutes by scoring his 15th league goal of the season, equalling Roberto Firmino's record for Brazilians in a Premier League campaign.[491] Duje Ćaleta-Car restored Southampton's two-goal cushion on 66 minutes with a header from a corner.[493] In the 88th minute, Ødegaard played a one-two with White and curled a shot from outside the box into the bottom left corner.[494] Two minutes later, Saka tucked home the rebound from a Nelson shot, making the score 3–3.[493] This was a third successive Premier League draw for the Gunners, moving them five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table, though Guardiola's side had two games in hand.[492]

The Premier League's top two went head-to-head on 26 April as Arteta's side travelled to the Etihad Stadium to take on Manchester City in the match that would have a huge bearing on who would win the title.[495] Saliba remained out with a back injury,[496] and Xhaka recovered from his illness to return to the starting line-up.[497] Ødegaard made his 100th appearance for the team in all competitions.[498] Kevin De Bruyne broke the deadlock on 7 minutes, rushing onto Erling Haaland's pass before arrowing a low shot past Ramsdale.[499] The hosts doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time through John Stones' header from De Bruyne's free-kick. The goal was initially disallowed for offside, but the decision was overturned following a VAR review.[496] Nine minutes after the restart, De Bruyne latched onto a loose pass by Ødegaard and found Haaland, who fed it back to the Belgian for his second of the night.[499] The Gunners pulled one back in the 86th minute when Trossard received the ball from Jorginho and played a pass to Holding, who lashed an effort past City goalkeeper Ederson.[497] Haaland netted in second-half stoppage time, sealing a 4–1 win for the hosts, and ending Arsenal's ten-game unbeaten run in the Premier League.[499] The defeat extended the Gunners' longest losing run against an opponent in their league history, as Arsenal had lost their last 12 Premier League games against City, losing by an aggregate score of 5–33.[497] The Gunners were the first side to concede at least two goals in four consecutive top-flight games in which they started the day top since Manchester United in December 1966, and they were also the first side to go four straight Premier League matches winless when starting the day top since themselves in March 2008.[497][499][500] After the match, their lead at the top of the league was cut to two points over Guardiola's side who had two games in hand and a superior goal difference.[496] Despite the loss, Arteta's side mathematically qualified for next season's UEFA Champions League after six-year absence.[497]

Though the Gunners' performances dropped significantly in April, some players were still recognised with monthly award nominations. Ramsdale's vital save to deny Liverpool's Salah won the Premier League Save of the Month award, making him the first Arsenal goalkeeper to receive the award back to back.[501][502]

May
The club started May with a 3–1 win over 12th-placed Chelsea at home on 2 May,[503] seeing their four-game winless run come to an end. Manager Arteta made three changes to his side from their defeat to Manchester City, bringing in January singings Kiwior who was handed his first Premier League start, Jorginho and Trossard for Holding, Partey and Martinelli, respectively.[504][505] The Gunners dominated the first half, with Ødegaard netting twice from Xhaka low crosses in the 18th and 31st minute, and Gabriel Jesus firing in the rebound of Xhaka's blocked shot on 34 minutes.[506] This meant that Arsenal became the first team to have three players (Saka, Martinelli and Ødegaard) to reach at least 20 goals and assists combined in the Premier League this campaign,[507][508] and it was the second time the club had four players (Saka, Martinelli, Ødegaard and Gabriel Jesus) reach double figures for goals in a Premier League season, after 2012–13.[509] Noni Madueke pulled one back for the visitors in the 65th minute.[506] The result secured the Gunners' third Premier League double over Chelsea since the 2019–20 season, their fourth in total;[505] and ensured it was the first time since February 2004 that Arsenal had won three consecutive Premier League games against the Blues.[509] The club had gone unbeaten in their 12 London derbies this Premier League campaign (won ten and drew two), the first time they had not lost any in a single season since 2004–05. This was their 150th London derby victory in the Premier League, making Arsenal the first side to reach this number in the competition.[508][510]

After the game, the club condemned the "dangerous and totally unacceptable" behaviour of a man for shining a laser in the face of Chelsea player Mykhailo Mudryk. The Metropolitan Police confirmed a 21-year-old man was arrested after the incident.[511][512]

The Gunners headed to the north east of England on 7 May facing 3rd-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park.[513] In the 7th minute, the hosts were awarded a penalty for Kiwior's handball, but the decision was overturned after referee Chris Kavanagh was suggested by VAR to review the incident which showed the ball hit the defender's leg and then went over his arm.[514] On 14 minutes, Jorginho pulled a short ball across towards skipper Ødegaard, who drilled a low shot from 25 yards into the bottom right corner.[515] This was the first time Arsenal had two players (Martinelli and Ødegaard) score 15 or more goals in a single Premier League campaign.[516][517] Arteta's side doubled their lead in the 71st minute when Martinelli's cross was poked into his own net by Newcastle defender Fabian Schär.[515] The 2–0 win meant that Arsenal became the third different side after Liverpool and Manchester City to take home three points from a Premier League game at St James' Park since Eddie Howe's appointment as manager 18 months ago.[514] Ramsdale made a number of saves in the match, including a reflex save from a close-range header by Schär on 49 minutes, becoming the third different goalkeeper to keep ten away clean sheets in a Premier League season, after Chelsea's Petr Čech and Manchester City's Ederson.[514] The Gunners had 81 points from 35 Premier League matches this campaign, a point behind leaders Manchester City who still had a game in hand;[514][516] but it was enough to ensure Arteta's side mathematically secured a top-two league finish – their best finish since 2016.[518]

On 14 May, Arsenal played at home to 7th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion.[519] Saliba remained out with his back issue, while Tierney replaced the injured Zinchenko.[520] Arteta was forced into an early change, as Martinelli was chopped down by a tackle from Moisés Caicedo, and was replaced by former Brighton player Trossard in the 20th minute.[521] Julio Enciso gave the Seagulls the lead with a close-range header on 51 minutes.[522] The visitors added a second in the 86th minute when Deniz Undav punished Trossard's loose pass by lobbing Ramsdale.[520] Pervis Estupiñán netted in the 6th minute of stoppage time, sealing a 3–0 win for Brighton.[522] This was the second time Arsenal were beaten at the Emirates in the league this campaign,[521] and was the third time they failed to score in a Premier League game this season.[522] The Gunners had conceded 25 goals at home in the Premier League this campaign, their joint-most in a single season.[520] In the post-match presser, Arteta said, "Today we have to apologise because the performance that we had in the second half is not acceptable."[520]

Kit information
This is Adidas's fourth year supplying Arsenal kit, having taken over from Puma at the beginning of the 2019–20 season.[702][703] On 30 September 2022, Arsenal announced the extension of the partnership with Adidas until 2030.[704][705]

Home: The club confirmed on 19 May 2022 that their new home kit for the 2022–23 season would debut in the final home game of the 2021–22 season. The home kit uses Arsenal's traditional colours of red and white. The shirt has a red body and white sleeves, and is complemented by white shorts and red socks. The new feature added to the home kit is a lightning bolt pattern appearing on the collar and socks.[706]
Away: On 18 July 2022, the Gunners released their new away kit. The all-black shirt combines a bronze cannon badge and metallic trims with an all-over AFC graphic, and is partnered with black shorts and socks.[707] White shorts and grey socks were used in some away games when there was a colour clash with the home team's kit. It was reported that Arsenal sold £1 million of the new away kit on launch day, a new club's record for first-day kit sales.[708][709]
Third: The new third kit was revealed on 29 July 2022, one day before the 2022 Emirates Cup match. It is the first pink outfield shirt in Arsenal's history. The shirt features an all-over ermine print, and is combined with navy shorts and pink socks.[710]
No More Red: On 6 January 2023, Arsenal announced that they were going to extend their "No More Red" campaign for a second season; an initiative that aims to combat knife crime in the capital. The same commemorative kit from last season was used this season, with typical white features set upon a slightly off-white kit.[711]
Goalkeeper: The new goalkeeper kits are based on Adidas's goalkeeper template for the season.

Pre-season and friendlies
On 19 April 2022, Arsenal announced that they would travel to the United States in July to compete in the FC Series as part of their preparations during pre-season with matches against Orlando City and Chelsea.[712] On 10 May, a further US tour friendly was confirmed against Everton in The Charm City Match in July.[713] On 18 May, La Liga side Sevilla revealed their participation in the 2022 Emirates Cup in late July.[714] On 6 June, Arsenal announced that they would travel to Germany to face 1. FC Nürnberg as part of a pre-season training camp at the Adidas headquarters in July, before heading to the US.[715]

In order to prepare for the resumption of the Premier League following the mid-season World Cup break, Arsenal announced that they were going to partake in a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in early December. This involved participating in the Dubai Super Cup against Lyon and Milan on 8 and 13 December respectively, at the Al Maktoum Stadium.[716] Points, in addition to those earned in the initial 90 minutes, would be awarded through a mandatory penalty shootout; the team with most points overall after two matches (alongside a fourth participant in fellow Premier League side Liverpool) would be crowned champions of the competition.[717] Arsenal then announced a final friendly against Serie A side Juventus to be played, at home, on 17 December, 9 days before the resumption of their domestic season.[718]

Premier League Save of the Month
The winner of the award was chosen by a combination of an online public vote and a panel of experts.

Ramsdale's vital save to deny Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara won March's Premier League Save of the Month award. It prevented Arsenal from going 2–0 down after 21 minutes of a match they ultimately went on to win 3–2 with Reiss Nelson netting the last-gasp winner.[471][472] His flying fingertip save to stop Liverpool's Salah from scoring a deflected curling shot in stoppage time won April's award. It secured the Gunners a 2–2 draw at Anfield.[501][502]

The following is a list of events affecting American television in 2022. Events listed include television show debuts, finales, and cancellations; channel launches, closures, and re-brandings; stations changing or adding their network affiliations; information on controversies, business transactions, and carriage disputes; and deaths of those who made various contributions to the medium.

Notable events
January
Date	Event	Source
1	Fox affiliate WDKY/Danville–Lexington, Kentucky launches an in-house news department, ending a news outsourcing agreement—one of the longest such agreements in American television history—that it had maintained with Gray-owned CBS affiliate WKYT (which debuted a separate prime time newscast for its CW-affiliated DT2 subchannel on that night) since its 10:00 p.m. newscast premiered in January 1995; WDKY employed its own anchors to present the WKYT-produced broadcasts, all of whom were retained for the new operation (accompanied by reporters, sportscasters and meteorologists hired for the in-house productions) as were some feature segments that originated on the outsourced newscasts. The switch to an in-house production follows the physical expansion and equipment upgrade of WDKY's studios by Nexstar Media Group (which acquired the station in September 2020 through a settlement over previous owner Sinclair's failed acquisition of Tribune Media, of which Nexstar acquired most assets in 2019). An expanded weekday morning newscast (increased to four hours from its previous one-hour runtime as a WKYT production) and a new half-hour early evening newscast subsequently debuted on January 3.	[1]
3	The Major League Baseball-owned MLB Network declines to renew the contract of insider Ken Rosenthal; it is believed to be the result of Rosenthal's criticisms of league commissioner Rob Manfred's handling of the pandemic-altered 2020 season. Rosenthal retains positions as MLB reporter for Fox Sports and writer for The Athletic (where he penned his critiques of Manfred).	[2]
Art Rascon retires from broadcasting after 36 years, 23 of which were with KTRK-TV/Houston (serving as a midday and 5:00 p.m. anchor and field reporter). On his final day at the ABC O&O, Rascon co-anchors its 11:00 a.m. newscast alongside son Jacob (previously with rival NBC affiliate KPRC), who made his KTRK debut as an anchor/reporter on that date.	[3][4]
[5]
4–6	Two late-night talk shows pause production after their hosts test positive for COVID-19: NBC's Late Night cancels its scheduled tapings through January 6 in the wake of host Seth Meyers' positive test one day after their January 3 return from a holiday production hiatus (Meyers' guests for that show joined in remotely). On the 6th, CBS' Late Late Show also goes dark through January 18 due to James Corden's own positive test. Meyers' and Corden's diagnoses come after Jimmy Fallon, whose The Tonight Show tapes in the same building as Late Night, revealed he tested COVID-positive after his show's December 17 taping, just before Tonight's own holiday hiatus; Fallon (who was fully vaccinated, as are Meyers and Corden) fully recovered before production resumed on January 3, meaning Tonight did not have to face postponements. However, Fallon was revealed to have been intended to make a cameo on Saturday Night Live's December 18 episode, and thus may have contributed to the episode's emergency reformatting. Late Night would return with Meyers hosting remotely for the week of January 10–13 with most crew members working from home or in-studio, before returning to the studio.	[6][7]
[8][9]
[10][11]
5	Thirteen current and former female staffers file a gender discrimination lawsuit against the Black News Channel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, claiming that management paid female employees significantly less than male staffers, harbored a misogynistic work culture that forced them to conform to behavioral gender stereotypes, and retaliated against those who complained about the pay disparities and personal treatment. Two of the plaintiffs in the amended lawsuit had filed a prior complaint against BNC in August 2021.	[12]
After Kevin Porter Jr. hits a game-winning three-pointer, Washington Wizards broadcaster Glenn Consor remarks on the NBC Sports Washington broadcast that the Houston Rockets star, "like his dad, pulled the trigger at the right time." But Consor's comment draws the ire on social media, from LeBron James and others, as Porter's father went to prison after pleading guilty in the 1993 shooting death of a 14-year-old girl. In apologizing for the incident, Consor claimed he thought Kevin Porter Jr. was related to former Washington player Kevin Porter.	[13]
7	The Magnolia Network, which replaced DIY Network three days before, pulls the home renovation series Home Work from their schedule and Discovery+ presence (where it had streamed since the summer of 2021), following allegations from three subject families of not meeting timelines, high additional costs, and lack of communication by the show's hosts, Andy and Candis Meredith. The show would be returned to the lineups on January 13.	[14][15]
By earning $42,220 in her 28th victory, Amy Schneider becomes the first female contestant and fourth overall to win over $1 million in regular gameplay on Jeopardy!. Schneider would go on to surpass Matt Amodio for the second-most consecutive wins in the game show's history with her 39th victory on January 24. Her win streak ended at 40 two days later. (Ken Jennings, who has presided over Schneider's win streak as part-time interim host, holds the most consecutive wins with 74 during his streak as Jeopardy! champion in 2004.)	[16][17]
[18]
9	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) hands out the 79th Golden Globe Awards, with notable TV winners including Succession (Best Drama Series), Hacks (Best Comedy Series), and Pose's Mj Rodriguez (the first openly trans person to win a Globe, for Best Actress in a Drama Series). The Globes are distributed in a private, non-televised ceremony (and winners announced via press release and the HPFA's social media channels) in light of broadcast rightsholder NBC's support of a boycott by various media organizations, actors, and other creatives over the HFPA's inadequate efforts to address the membership diversity of the organization (NBC carried the final game of the NFL regular season played between the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders on this evening).	[19][20]
[21][22]
12	Richard Burgi confirms in an Instagram post that he was fired from The Young and the Restless for an inadvertent breach of distributor Sony Pictures Television's COVID-19 protocols, disclosing that he isolated for five days after testing COVID-positive during the CBS soap opera's holiday production hiatus in December—in accordance with prior CDC guidelines, revised that month to a five-day isolation period—rather than the SPT requirement for personnel to isolate for ten days which had not been revised. He then returned to the set five days early, testing negative twice. In contrast to other soap actors that were fired for COVID policy violations in 2021, some of whom publicly criticized their studios and networks, Burgi expressed sincere regret for his judgement. Robert Newman, known for playing Josh Lewis on Guiding Light off-and-on from 1981 until its 2009 conclusion, assumed the role of Ashland Locke (which Burgi had played since the character debuted in March 2021) on the February 9 episode, and portrayed the character on-screen until July 25.	[23][24]
14	DirecTV announces it would cease carriage of One America News Network and AWE when the namesake satellite provider and sister service U-verse TV’s contract with parent company Herring Networks expires on April 4. The radicalist-leaning, conservative OAN has received criticism for pushing conspiracy theories (particularly involving COVID-19 vaccines and health restrictions, and debunked claims of electoral fraud during the 2020 presidential election and left-wing involvement in the January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol) while gaining support from former president Donald Trump. Wealth culture-focused AWE has had issues involving the low overall appeal of its programming during economic recessions (most recently during the COVID-19 recession), and aggressive carriage demands. Seven months later on July 21, Verizon Fios, which became the network's largest remaining pay-TV carrier after the DirecTV removal, announced it would drop OAN on July 31, after failing to agree on a new contract; this relegates OAN's distribution to smaller cable providers and OTA subchannels in select markets, ad-supported live-TV streaming platforms (including Pluto TV and Xumo), and its proprietary subscription streaming service.	[25][26]
[27]
19	WSAZ/Huntington, West Virginia multimedia journalist Tori Yorgey is struck by an SUV while reporting live from the scene of a water main break in Dunbar during that night's 11:00 p.m. newscast. Yorgey—who conducted the report roadside in wet and icy conditions, and continued with the report afterward—was uninjured, but was taken to a local hospital for observation as a precaution. (The accident occurred during Yorgey's last week at WSAZ; she became a reporter for ABC affiliate WTAE/Pittsburgh on February 1.)	[28]
24	Deadline Hollywood reports ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) halted its proposed reformatting of the general entertainment Paramount Network as the primarily film-focused Paramount Movie Network, citing the success of original drama series Yellowstone and COVID-related production delays of its planned telefilm output. First announced in September 2020, the reformatted channel was to offer original made-for-cable movies (including 52 new films per year), limited scripted series and miniseries (at least one per quarter), and films from the Paramount Pictures library. In preparation for the change, several of the network's original unscripted programs were either canceled outright or moved to its sister channels or to Paramount+ during late 2020 and 2021.	[29]
25	Bravo fires Jennie Nguyen from the cast of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City after racially offensive comments and memes, including many mocking the Black Lives Matter movement, that she shared on Facebook during the 2020 anti-police brutality protests had resurfaced on social media.	[30]
26	TLC fires Alina Kozhevnikova from the cast of 90 Day Fiancé (as well as spin-offs Before the 90 Days and the upcoming 90 Day Fiancé: Tell All) after past social media posts mocking various races and religions resurfaced (among them, a now-deleted 2014 post in which she used "nigga" eight times when describing a party she had been invited to in her native Russia, and one from 2015 mocking Hugh Grant's eldest daughter, who is half-Chinese, for being "kinda Asian.").	[31]
27	Stephanie Ruhle is named permanent anchor of The 11th Hour. In addition to her usual 9:00 a.m. ET slot (absorbed by Morning Joe upon her move), she had been serving as one of several rotating hosts of the MSNBC program since original anchor Brian Williams's departure from the network in December. It took effect on March 2.	[32][33]
31	During a discussion on The View about the controversy surrounding the McMinn County, Tennessee school district's January 10 ban of the Holocaust-focused graphic novel Maus, moderator Whoopi Goldberg claims that the Holocaust was about "man's inhumanity to man" and not based on race (appearing to characterize race—as she clarified during her appearance on that night's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert—in the narrower construct of ethnicity/skin color, rather than the broader outgroup context in line with Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party's view of Jews as an "inferior race" on religious grounds). Goldberg later apologized for the remarks amid widespread criticism from Jewish groups, and was placed on a two-week suspension by ABC News on February 1; she returned to The View on February 14.	[34][35]

2	Jeff Zucker resigns as President of CNN, a role he held since 2013, after admitting that he failed to disclose his romantic relationship with CNN Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Allison Gollust, a former aide to ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the wake of the sexual harassment allegations that led to Cuomo's resignation the year prior. The scandal also led to the December 2021 firing of Cuomo Prime Time host Chris Cuomo for assisting in his brother's defense against the allegations. Gollust would resign on February 15, after the investigation's findings that they all violated company policy was released. On February 26, it was reported Chris Licht, co-creator of Morning Joe and executive producer of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, would become CNN's new president upon formation of Warner Bros. Discovery.	[37][38]
[39]
Deadline Hollywood reports that The Masked Singer judges Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong walked off a taping of the Fox series the previous week after Rudy Giuliani was revealed to be a contestant. The other judges, Jenny McCarthy and Nicole Scherzinger, remained on stage and spoke with the former New York City mayor who was among the allies of Donald Trump falsely alleging the 2020 election was stolen after Trump lost his re-election bid. The episode aired on April 20, the seventh week of the competition.	[40][41]
3[42]–20	The 2022 Winter Olympics took place in Beijing, China, and aired on NBC and its U.S. cable networks as well as streaming on Peacock. The event marked the first time that NBC has broadcast the Olympics in back-to-back years, having aired the 2020 Summer Olympics less than seven months prior due to the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the event from its original July 2020 start date. (The Summer and Winter Olympics—for which NBC assumed exclusive broadcast rights in 1988 and 2002, respectively—have typically alternated every two years within each four-year interval since 1994, and occurred in the same calendar year during each interval from 1924 to 1992, outside of World War II-prompted cancellations.) It also marks the first time that NBCUniversal will provide full streaming coverage without requiring a pay-TV subscription, as Peacock will provide live coverage of all Olympic events, with replays made available upon each event's conclusion, as well as ancillary content (including opening, closing and medal ceremonies, and NBC's prime time and studio programming) via its subscription tiers. (NBC previously restricted access to most event livestreams via provider login through its dedicated Olympics website and app; however, Peacock provided limited live event coverage without such a requirement for the 2020 games.) On January 19, NBC Sports announced that all announcing talent for the games would be based out of its studios in Stamford, Connecticut in response to the Omicron variant.	[43][44]
[45]
5	Andrea Bordeaux is fired from the Starz series Run the World, after she refused to comply with the show's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Bordeaux's character, Ella McFair, will not be recast.	[46]
7	Bertram van Munster, co-creator and executive producer of The Amazing Race, is sued on multiple complaints (including fraud, breach of oral contract and misappropriation of trade secrets) filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court by former CBS executive Leigh Collier, who alleged that van Munster recreated New Media Collective, a production company that they originally co-founded in 2014 before dissolving two years later, without her knowledge. Collier is seeking a share of profits and a 33% interest in the company.	[47]
9	In a first for ESPN's NBA coverage, this evening's broadcast of a Golden State Warriors–Utah Jazz NBA game is headed by an all-female on-air crew, including play-by-play announcer Beth Mowins, analyst Doris Burke, and sideline reporter Lisa Salters. Additionally, the broadcast's directing chair and 33 other production positions in Salt Lake City (where the game is played) and ESPN's Bristol, Connecticut control room are occupied by female staffers.	[48]
13	The Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20 in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on NBC. The game—which was the first Super Bowl to take place on a calendar date falling within the scheduled date range of an ongoing Olympics event—was originally going to be aired on CBS, but it was traded to NBC (under an agreement reached in March 2019) so that it could be paired with the Winter Olympics to avoid potential dilution of viewership and advertising revenue for the two events. The switch also affected the NFL Honors, which occurred on February 10 broadcast on ABC and ESPN. The halftime show was headlined by rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar with appearances by 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak. The game marked the last for Al Michaels as NBC's lead play-by-play broadcaster. He will remain with NBC in an emeritus capacity while also joining Prime Video as its play-by-play broadcaster for Thursday Night Football beginning with the 2022 season (Mike Tirico becomes the primary NBC Sunday Night Football announcer in the process). The Super Bowl is also the final NBC Sports assignment for sideline reporter Michele Tafoya, who left to pursue a career as a conservative commentator and political consultant. It is also Pepsi's last sponsored halftime show following the expiration of their 10-year contract.	[49][50]

14	Friends of WLRN Inc., which has served as the fundraising arm of School Board of Miami-Dade County's public broadcasting operations since 1974, agrees to take over full-management of secondary PBS member station WLRN-TV and its news/talk FM sister (including its digital channels and satellite FM station WKWM/Marathon). The group had clashed with the school board in recent years after Miami-Dade County Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho and a committee recommended that a competing bid by South Florida PBS (which operates WPBT/Miami and WXEL/West Palm Beach) be selected.	[56]
16	ViacomCBS changes its name to Paramount Global. The rebranding—which draws from its flagship studio Paramount Pictures and namesake streaming service Paramount+—retires the Viacom name after 52 years, dating back to the original company (originally formed as the CBS-owned syndication unit CBS Television Film Sales in 1952) and carried over to its successor entity following the 2006 separation of CBS and the original Viacom's assets.	[57]
17	Former 9-1-1 star Rockmond Dunbar sues 20th Television and parent The Walt Disney Company over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and their rejection of the religious exemptions he sought which led to his abrupt departure from the series in November. He claims discrimination and career sabotage.	[58]
Everett Fitzhugh (filling in for regular play-by-play announcer John Forslund) and J. T. Brown call this date's Seattle Kraken-Winnipeg Jets game for Root Sports Northwest, and in doing so make history as the first all-Black duo to call a National Hockey League TV broadcast.	[59]
22	Standard General and Apollo Global Management announce their intent to acquire Tegna Inc. for $5.4 billion; a Standard General affiliate company will assume voting equity in Tegna, while Cox Media Group and Apollo (through funding managed by an Apollo affiliate firm) will hold securities not attributable to voting interests. Concurrently, Cox (which is majority owned by Apollo) will acquire Tegna-owned stations in Austin (KVUE), Dallas–Fort Worth (WFAA and KMPX) and Houston (KHOU and KTBU), and Standard-owned stations in Paducah–Cape Girardeau (KBSI and WDKA), Lincoln (KLKN) and Providence (WLNE); Standard will acquire WFXT/Boston from Cox in turn. Deb McDermott will be appointed as Tegna's CEO after the sale's closure, which is expected to occur during the second half of 2022, barring potential opposition from federal regulators over Apollo's existing Cox and proposed Tegna interests.	[60][61]
24	CNN announces it will cut back the use of its "squeezeback" ad units, which allow for commercials to play without cutting away from live coverage; the network's move follows juxtaposition of upbeat ads, including one from Applebee's against footage of air raid sirens sounding across Kyiv, coming out of its coverage of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine (Applebee's would pull its ads from the network altogether).	[62][63]
California–Oregon Broadcasting Inc. announces its intent to sell its Eugene, Oregon duopoly of Fox affiliate KLSR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KEVU-CD to Cox Media Group; the purchase price was not initially disclosed. Following its expected completion during the second quarter of the year, the sale will leave NBC affiliate KOBI/Medford and its Klamath Falls satellite KOTI as California–Oregon Broadcasting's only remaining television properties.	[64]
27	KCRG-TV/Cedar Rapids, Iowa announces the termination of its morning anchor Jay Greene for an undisclosed incident the station determined violated its code of conduct. The firing leaves the Gray Television-owned ABC affiliate with two anchor openings, as evening anchor Chris Earl departed for a position in Florida earlier in the month.	[65]
The 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards air on TBS and TNT from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. It would end up being the final ceremony aired on the networks (see May 4 entry). Noted TV-related winners include the casts of Succession and Ted Lasso (Outstanding Drama and Comedy Series Ensembles), as well as Lee Jung-jae and HoYeon Jung (Outstanding Male and Female Drama Series Actors) of Squid Game, the first non-English language TV series to win SAG Awards.	[66]
28	A group representing owners and executives of the original United States Football League (fronted by Larry Csonka, acting in his capacity as former general manager of that league's Jacksonville Bulls), files a federal lawsuit against Fox Sports and subsidiary National Spring Football League Enterprises Co, LLC, seeking an injunction to prevent a new, Fox-owned USFL from using the trademarks associated with the original league (which operated from 1983 to 1986 and was officially dissolved in 1990). On April 14, a judge rules that, though the plaintiffs were "likely to prevail" on their trademark infringement claim, there was little risk of "irreparable harm" in allowing the new USFL and its eight initial teams to proceed play two days later (see April 16 entry) using league and team names and insignias employed by the original league.	[67][68]

1	Turner Sports obtains the English-language rights to United States men's and women's national soccer team matches beginning in 2023. Through the United States Soccer Federation's eight-year deal with the WarnerMedia division, HBO Max will stream more than 20 matches, with TNT or TBS simulcasting select matches. Turner's Bleacher Report website also gains rights to expanded content through the agreement.	[71]
Production on Season 7 of Nailed It! is permanently suspended after staffers on the Netflix baking competition go on strike, an effort to win a union contract between the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and the show's production company, Magical Elves. The four episodes that had been finished are expected to run on Netflix in the fall, to coincide with the season's Halloween theme.	[72]
7	The 57th Academy of Country Music Awards are broadcast on Amazon Prime Video from Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. Hosted by Dolly Parton, it is one of the first major awards ceremonies on U.S. television to move exclusively to a subscription video on demand (SVOD) streaming service. (Prime Video replaced previous rightsholder CBS, which had aired the ACMs from 1998 to 2021.) With two wins each, Miranda Lambert ("Entertainer of the Year", and "Video of the Year" for "Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)" in collaboration with Elle King), Carly Pearce ("Female Artist of the Year", and "Music Event of the Year" for "Never Wanted to Be That Girl" in collaboration with Ashley McBryde) and Lainey Wilson ("Song of the Year" for "Things a Man Oughta Know", and "New Female Artist of the Year") were tied for the most awards.	[73][74]
[75]
8	Apple TV+ announces a deal with Major League Baseball to air a weekly doubleheader of Friday night games, a package that will launch with the 2022 season. Its first broadcasts will be April 8, with the New York Mets against the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros against the Los Angeles Angels. The exclusive broadcasts—which will be produced by MLB and feature pre-game, post-game, and other ancillary programming—will be the first foray into live-streaming sporting events for Apple TV+.	[76][77]
13	The 27th Critics' Choice Awards aired simultaneously on both TBS and The CW (the latter network is a joint venture between Paramount Global and WarnerMedia, thus the ability to simulcast with TBS, in an arrangement announced on October 26, 2021). The ceremony—co-hosted by Taye Diggs and Nicole Byer, and coinciding with the 75th BAFTA Awards—took place at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, California. The awards were postponed from its original January 9 date on December 22, 2021, due to safety concerns related to the COVID Omicron variant. With four awards, Ted Lasso had the most wins among television nominees ("Best Comedy Series", Jason Sudeikis for "Best Actor in a Comedy Series", Brett Goldstein for "Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series", and Hannah Waddingham for "Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series").	[21][78]
[79][80]
[81][82]
14	Fox News says its state department correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting on the war in Ukraine near Kyiv. Hall's cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski and consultant Oleksandra "Sasha" Kuvshynova were killed by the blast that leaves Hall with severe injuries to his legs, a hand, and an eye, as well as damage to his hearing.	[83][84]
[85]
16	Confirming an earlier report by the New York Post's Andrew Marchand, ESPN announces that Joe Buck will join the network as play-by-play announcer for Monday Night Football beginning in the 2022 NFL season, working alongside Fox Sports partner Troy Aikman, who had earlier agreed to join ESPN in a separate five-year deal. One of Fox Sports' original on-air hires when it began operations in 1994, Buck had been its lead voice for Major League Baseball, USGA golf, and, with Aikman as analyst since 2002, NFL football. In exchange for granting Buck a release from the final year of his contract with Fox, the network receives from ESPN the rights to an extra Big Ten Conference football game for the 2022 college football season.	[86][87]
[88]
17	Amazon closes its acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, an $8.5 billion deal first announced in May 2021, which included ownership of MGM Television, and pay television channels Epix, Screenpix and MGM HD, and management interests in Sinclair-owned multicast networks Charge! and Comet. In addition to maintaining the studio's existing planned productions and scheduled releases, Amazon will not relegate MGM's television and film content exclusively to Prime Video and IMDb TV, allowing the studio to continue licensing its titles to linear television networks and competing streaming services.	[89]
27	The 94th Academy Awards air on ABC from the Dolby Theatre, and was co-hosted by Wanda Sykes, Amy Schumer and Regina Hall. The ceremony's later-than-usual date avoided a conflict with the Winter Olympics. CODA won Best Picture, becoming the first streaming-exclusive film to win the award, and Apple TV+ the first streaming service to do so; it also won for Best Supporting Actor (Troy Kotsur, the first deaf actor to win the category) and Best Adapted Screenplay. Ariana DeBose won Best Supporting Actress for her role in West Side Story, becoming the first queer woman of color and first Afro-Latina to win a major Oscar category. During the Best Documentary Feature presentation, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on-stage after the comedian ad-libbed a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith's, shaved head during his monologue. (Pinkett Smith was diagnosed with alopecia areata in 2018.) ABC muted most of the audio from the confrontation, which aired in full on many international broadcasters, omitting Smith's remarks for Rock to "keep [Jada's] name out [of his] fucking mouth"; Smith apologized for the altercation in his Best Actor acceptance speech (for his role in King Richard) later in the ceremony and to Rock on Instagram the next day. The telecast ran for nearly four hours, despite a controversial attempt to trim its length by offloading eight awards to pre-recorded segments.	[90][91]
[92][93]
[94][95]
29	Mick Mulvaney, former White House Chief of Staff under Donald Trump, is hired by CBS News as a contributor to provide analysis on political matters.

The episode would later air on October 4, as part of the show's fifth season.	[148]
25	A technical glitch is blamed for WFAA/Dallas–Fort Worth not carrying the opening monologue of that night's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, in which Kimmel commented on the Uvalde shooting and called on Congressional lawmakers (including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who opposes such measures) to pass legislation to curb gun violence. The ABC affiliate noted that the program was scheduled to run later than its normal 10:35 p.m. Central slot due to a special edition of its late newscast focusing on the shooting; however, its automated master control system ended up playing a commercial break instead of Kimmel. WFAA management apologized for the error, which Kimmel did not believe to be intentional, and a clip of the monologue from the show's YouTube channel was embedded to the station's website.	[149]

The Fox broadcast network and Fox News Channel carry their normal lineups, however, with the former's affiliates being allowed to pick up Fox Business' coverage on an individual basis. This night's hearing attracts at least an estimated (by Nielsen) 20 million viewers across traditional television, a number on par with NBC Sunday Night Football and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

17	Vince McMahon agrees to relinquish his duties as CEO and chairman of WWE; daughter Stephanie McMahon becomes the company's interim CEO/chair, but would permanently take those titles at Vince's July 22 retirement (with Paul "Triple H" Levesque taking on the Head of Creative title Vince had still retained). A misconduct investigation by the WWE board is the reason for the elder McMahon's departure, with reports indicating that he had paid more than $12 million over a 16-year period to four former WWE employees, an effort to keep suppressed allegations of acts of sexual misconduct and adulterous relationships between McMahon and the women. McMahon, who would remain WWE's largest shareholder, returned to the company as executive chairman through a January 2023 shakeup of its board of directors.	[163][164]

This ceremony is the first affected by a major Daytime/Primetime Emmy realignment where, in response to the growth of streaming television, the two ceremonies' scopes now revolve more around factors such as a show's theme, format, and style, instead of strictly dayparts (talk shows, for instance, are now generally divided between the ceremonies based on common formats).

11	Nexstar Media Group's Washington duopoly of WDVM (Ind.) and WDCW (CW) launches a joint news operation—branded as "D.C. News Now"—utilizing WDVM's existing news staff to present the expanded broadcasts. WDVM began producing a 10:00 p.m. newscast for WDCW (debuting on July 25 as its first prime time newscast since a prior effort produced by former sister station WTVR/Richmond from 2016 to 2018; WDVM's existing 10:00 newscast moved to 9:00 as a result), along with extending its weekday morning newscast by one hour (to 31⁄2 hours) and adding a new nightly 11:00 p.m. sports discussion show (replacing a Northern Virginia-focused late newscast). The expansion of WDVM's news production to WDCW—which Nexstar acquired through its 2019 purchase of Tribune Media—follows the physical expansion of the latter's Glover Park facility to accommodate WDVM's news operations and offices. (WDVM's former Hagerstown studio was converted into a news bureau, joining those in Frederick, Maryland and Chantilly, Virginia.)	[178][179]
In an agreement with federal prosecutors for New York's Southern District, Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jen Shah pleads guilty to a wire fraud conspiracy charge for her involvement in a nationwide telemarketing scheme, one that sold (and refused refunds on purchases for) various "essentially non-existent" services and targeted senior citizens and the computer illiterate.

(The KSTW broadcast is the station's first news effort since the 2005 cancellation of a KIRO-produced 10:00 newscast; KSTW previously maintained an in-house news operation from 1953 to 1998.) National segments for all Now broadcasts originate from WCBS's New York studios.	[186][187]

Allen Media Group, TWC's Black-owned parent company, apologized for the incident (which originated not with the company, but, as programming and maintenance of TWC's WeatherStar systems is mainly conducted at the local system level, at Mediacom's headend operations), and stated it would investigate how the message made it on-air.

4	Following earlier indications by company management of a consolidation of its two major streaming services, Warner Bros. Discovery announces it will combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into a single, yet-to-be-named service in mid-2023. Citing HBO Max's technical issues since its May 2020 rollout (as it runs on the infrastructure originally used for predecessor services HBO Go and HBO Now, which was designed to support the even smaller content selection and technical demands of HBO Max), the combined offering will run on Discovery+'s existing app infrastructure and utilize that service's technical operations. The planned merger later results in the removal of 36 titles from HBO Max plus all films in the Harry Potter film series and nearly 200 episodes of children's series Sesame Street. The plans to fully merge the services is abandoned in February 2023, leaving Discovery+ alone as a standalone service. However, the programming changes will not be undone as a direct result, and rebranding HBO Max is still planned.	[197][198][199]

15	Nexstar Media Group announces it will acquire a 75% controlling interest in The CW from Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery, which will each retain 12.5% shares in the network in exchange for Nexstar assuming $100 million in losses incurred by its original co-parents. Nexstar, which would close its purchase on October 3, plans to reduce The CW's operating costs, intending to make the network profitable by 2025, and acquire programming of broader appeal to viewers outside of its existing 18–34 target demographic; it will also allow Paramount and WBD to continue producing scripted programs for The CW, with the option of extending the content deal past the 2022–23 season.	[204][205]
18	The Big Ten Conference announces new deals (their total sum reportedly surpassing $7 billion) with Fox Sports, CBS Sports, and NBC Sports that will see those networks, beginning in the 2023–24 academic year, share rights to Big Ten football and men's basketball games, most notably the creation of a football triple-header among the networks and exclusive broadcasts of select football games on NBC's Peacock streaming service. The additions of NBC and CBS to the Big Ten broadcast mix, alongside incumbent Fox, means the end of a long-standing agreement between the conference and ESPN, which balked at the estimated $380 million price tag to retain a share of the rights, and will, barring a possible sublicense agreement, part ways after the 2022–23 athletic season with the conference it had broadcast rights to since 1982 (corporate sibling ABC's relationship with the conference dates back to 1966).	[206][207]
22	Star Jones takes over as presiding judge/arbiter of Divorce Court, as the series begins the 24th season of its current syndicated iteration (and its 40th season overall); she succeeds Faith Jenkins, who became the show's arbitrator in September 2020. It marks a return to the syndicated court show genre for the lawyer, legal analyst and original co-host of ABC's The View: Jones was herself the first African-American court show arbiter, as judge for the 1994–95 series Jones & Jury.	[208][209]
23	Monumental Sports & Entertainment, already a 33% owner of NBC Sports Washington, announces it will buy the remainder of the regional sports network from NBCUniversal, with NBCU providing transitional corporate, technical, and distribution support for up to 18 months after the sale is completed (expected by the end of September). A rebrand to Monumental is expected for the network, which already carries broadcasts of the NHL's Washington Capitals and NBA's Washington Wizards, both Monumental-owned teams.	[210]
25	FanDuel Group announces plans to rebrand TVG Network as FanDuel TV in September to complement the company's sports betting initiatives. Kay Adams, the former anchor of Good Morning Football on NFL Network, will headline programming with a daily talk show, while Pat McAfee and The Ringer contribute additional content. Live horse racing will remain a key part of the network's lineup, with coverage of basketball from Australia, China, France, and Germany joining it.	[211]
26	Production for the upcoming Apple TV+ series Lady in the Lake is temporarily halted after on-location producers and crew in downtown Baltimore are approached by a group threatening violence unless they receive a $50,000 extortion payment. The producers report the incident to the Baltimore Police Department and seek out a new filming location with increased security.	[212]
28	The 2022 MTV Video Music Awards air on MTV and its related digital and linear platforms.

3	KJRH/Tulsa weekend morning anchor Julie Chin suffers the early stages of a stroke during the Scripps-owned NBC affiliate's Saturday morning newscast, while presenting a story about an event being held that weekend at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium. Chin—who experienced partial loss of vision in one eye that impaired her ability to view the teleprompter, garbled speech and numbness in one of her arms—said in a Facebook post that she had no indicative symptoms before the broadcast; she is expected to recover.	[214][215]
7	Dish Network removes Game Show Network from the lineups of its namesake satellite service and vMVPD provider Sling TV after failing to reach a renewal agreement with network parent Sony Pictures Television. The network returned to Dish and Sling on September 27, after Sony and Dish reached a new carriage agreement.	[216][217]
8	Buckingham Palace announces the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. When her death is announced at 18:30 BST (13:30 EST and 10:30 PST), the three major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) and all major cable news networks (including CNN, MSNBC and Fox News) break into regular programming to provide coverage.	
9	Days of Our Lives airs for the final time on NBC after 57 years, with the episode's final moments being interrupted in some markets in the Eastern and Central Time Zones by NBC News' coverage of King Charles III's first official speech as the United Kingdom's reigning monarch. With Days' move to NBCUniversal-owned Peacock on September 12, NBC becomes the first Big Three network to cease offering serials or any other entertainment programming within its daytime lineup (a first for NBC since it commenced regular weekday daytime programming in 1949); it fills the schedule void with a new one-hour midday newscast, NBC News Daily (which is also simulcast on NBC News Now).	[218][219]

11	Shannon Bream becomes the new permanent moderator of Fox News Sunday, occupying the role Chris Wallace vacated when he left Fox News in December 2021 to join CNN. (A series of guest hosts had filled in on the Fox network political talk show since Wallace's departure.) Bream, who retains her duties as chief legal correspondent for Fox News, moves over to Fox News Sunday from the host role at Fox News Channel's Fox News @ Night.	[220]
12	The 74th Primetime Emmy Awards air on NBC, with Kenan Thompson as host. The second Emmy ceremony (after the June 24 Daytime Emmys) to focus toward themes, format, and style, instead of strictly dayparts, these Primetime Emmys feature Outstanding Series wins for Succession (Outstanding Drama Series), Ted Lasso (Outstanding Comedy Series), and The White Lotus (Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series). Other noteworthy wins include Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae for Outstanding Lead Dramatic Actor and Hwang Dong-hyuk for Outstanding Dramatic Series Director (Squid Game was the first non-English series to earn Primetime Emmy nominations); and Abbott Elementary's Sheryl Lee Ralph for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, becoming the second Black female to win in the category (after 227's Jackée Harry in 1987).

The Kansas City Chiefs defeat the Los Angeles Chargers, 27–24, in Amazon Prime Video's official debut as the exclusive broadcaster of Thursday Night Football, part of the streaming service's rights deal with the National Football League. While the broadcast earns praise for the pairing of veteran NFL play-by-play broadcaster Al Michaels with college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit, and for its production and graphics quality, some viewers report technological issues with the game's stream, including pixelated images and audio/video being out of sync. Nielsen estimates an average audience of 13 million viewers for the broadcast, though Amazon puts it at 15 million when factoring in its own data.	[226][227]

16	A St. Louis jury convicts James "Tim" Norman on all counts of murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud in the March 2016 killing of his nephew, Andre Montgomery. Both Norman and Montgomery were regulars on the reality series Welcome to Sweetie Pie's, which ran on OWN from 2011 to 2018.	[229]
17	During a segment of the station's weekend morning newscast, KTLA/Los Angeles anchor Mark Mester emotionally goes off-script and apologizes, on the station's behalf, for what he calls their "cruel" and "inappropriate" handling of co-anchor Lynette Romero's abrupt departure earlier in the week. (It was later revealed that Romero would join NBC O&O KNBC in October as weekday co-anchor of its morning newscast, Today in L.A.) KTLA would suspend Mester over his actions on September 19, and would announce his dismissal from the Nexstar-owned CW affiliate on September 22.	[230][231]
19	Erick Adame announces he has been terminated from his meteorologist position at New York City cable news channel NY1 after images of him performing virtual sex acts were sent to his employer. Adame, who filed a lawsuit to discover the identity of the individual who shared the visuals, apologized for what he called unprofessional conduct but would not "apologize for being openly gay or sex-positive."

13 major TV networks across the United States, including all major cable news networks and the Big Three Television Networks broadcast the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.
20	Thirteen years after the NBA franchise's last regular local over-the-air game telecast, the Los Angeles Clippers reach an agreement with KTLA/Los Angeles to air 15 games from its 2022–23 schedule (four preseason and 11 regular season) on the Nexstar-owned CW affiliate. The sub-licensing agreement with Bally Sports SoCal, which renewed its contract with the team on October 7 and will air the remainder of its local game telecasts, includes carriage of team-related programs on KTLA and its KTLA+ streaming channel, and regional simulcasts on sister stations KSWB/San Diego, KGET/Bakersfield and KSEE/Fresno. (The team's first broadcast under the deal was a September 30 exhibition game against the Israeli National League’s Maccabi Ra'anana.) KTLA previously aired live Clippers games from 1985 to 1991 and from 2002 to 2009.	[233][234]

28	Fort Myers Broadcasting Company and affiliate company Sun Broadcasting’s shared broadcasting facility in downtown Fort Myers, Florida is inundated by storm surge flooding caused by Hurricane Ian (which made landfall in Cayo Costa earlier that day) from nearby Billy Creek. The companies’ respective TV and radio properties (including FMBC-owned CBS affiliate WINK-TV and its CW-affiliated SSA partner WXCW, which is owned by Sun) were knocked off the air early that evening, after the building lost generator power; employees that remained in the building were evacuated by local firefighters later that night. WINK returned to the air on September 30 from a makeshift studio at its transmitter site north of Fort Myers Shores.	[236][237]
29	Telling his audience "My time is up," Trevor Noah announces that he will be stepping down as host of The Daily Show on December 8, reportedly to focus more on his stand-up comedy and other projects.

1	The Walt Disney Television suite of networks (including Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, National Geographic, and eight ABC-owned local stations) are dropped from Dish Network and vMVPD provider Sling TV, one day after Dish and Disney fail to renew a carriage deal that expired on September 30. The networks return to Dish and Sling on October 2, after what Disney terms a "handshake agreement" to work toward a new retransmission pact between the two sides.	[240][241]
3	On the day Nexstar Media Group closes its purchase of controlling interest in The CW (see August 15 entry), Mark Pedowitz announces that he would step down as The CW's chairman and CEO, departing the network after an 11½-year run. Longtime media executive Dennis Miller is appointed to succeed Pedowitz as The CW's president, concurrently moving down from his seat on Nexstar's board of directors.	[242]
Former U.S. president Donald Trump sues CNN for defamation, seeking $475 million in punitive damages on allegations that the network carried out a "campaign of libel and slander" against him. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, asserts on-air references to Trump's allegations that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him as the "Big Lie" drew comparisons between him and Adolf Hitler (who coined the term in his 1925 book Mein Kampf).	[243]
11	Warner Bros. Discovery announces the layoffs of 125 employees (totaling 26% of personnel) within its Warner Bros. Television Group unit. The company will also combine the creative development and programming teams of Warner Horizon Unscripted Television and Telepictures, and the development and production teams of Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios. It also announced the shutdowns of digital short-form programming division Stage 13 and writing/directing diversity initiative Warner Bros. Television Workshop, though it reversed its decision on the latter later that day after criticism from talent and industry executives, choosing instead to move the workshops to WBD's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion unit.

After a two-year agreement with PBS Kids expires, Wildbrain again pulls the three major Peanuts television specials off linear television and makes them exclusive to Apple TV+. It is the second effort to move the specials from traditional TV to streaming, after an earlier attempt in 2020 was aborted in the face of public outcry, resulting in Apple sub-licensing the specials to PBS. As a result, A Charlie Brown Christmas will not be televised over-the-air for the first time in 57 years; the special had aired annually since its 1965 debut on CBS, ABC, or PBS.	[247]
15	Nexstar Media Group removes 13 television stations it owns and/or operates (WPIX/New York City, WPHL/Philadelphia, WTEN–WXXA/Albany, WIVB–WNLO/Buffalo, WPRI–WNAC/Providence, WRIC/Richmond, WHTM/Harrisburg, WAVY–WVBT/Norfolk, and WDCW–WDVM/Washington, D.C.) and its news/entertainment channel NewsNation from Verizon Fios, one day after Verizon and Nexstar fail to renew their expired carriage agreement.	[248]
20	23 stations owned by Mission Broadcasting (including WXXA/Albany, WLAJ/Lansing, KLRT–KASN/Little Rock, WTVW/Evansville, and KMSS/Shreveport) are removed from DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse TV, after the Nexstar Media Group affiliate company and DirecTV fail to renew a carriage agreement that expired the day prior. The blackout occurred nearly two weeks after DirecTV entered into a separate dispute with Nexstar-affiliated White Knight Broadcasting, which pulled WVLA/Baton Rouge and KFXK/Longview from the former's television services on October 7.	[249][250]
Newsmax TV bans journalist Lara Logan from future appearances on the conservative news network, after an on-air rant during an October 19 interview on Eric Bolling: The Balance, in which the former CBS News correspondent and Fox Nation host pushed conspiratorial talking points associated with the far-right Q-Anon movement. Logan—who claimed she talked to a man with documents claiming he had infiltrated "the global cabal" at the United Nations—made references to the "Great Replacement" immigration theory, suggested open borders are "Satan’s way of taking control of the world" through immigration, and invoked claims of blood libel. In a statement, Newsmax TV condemned Logan's statements as "reprehensible."	[251][252]
22	Formula One formally announces the extension of its U.S. media rights deal with ESPN through 2025; no monetary terms are expressed in the announcement, though reports in June indicated the network agreed to pay $75–90 million annually in the new deal (an increase from the current deal's $5 million/year fee).	[253][254]
30	The Big 12 Conference announces a new six-year media rights deal with ESPN and Fox Sports for $2.28 billion (an annual average of $380 million), the deal will run from the 2025–26 to the 2030–31 academic years following the end of the current deal that expires in 2024–25. ESPN will have the "A" package, for which it will get the top four picks, six of the top eight picks, eight out of the top 12 picks and twelve out of the top 20 picks for its football telecasts. It will also gain the rights to all of the conference's tournament championships including the football championship, which will remain on ABC; all other tournament championships (including the men's and women's basketball tournaments) will be televised on ESPN's linear channels, with ESPN+ retaining supplementary streaming rights to most Big 12 conference sports (including football) and ABC retaining broadcast television rights. Fox Sports will have the "B" package, which includes 26 football games on Fox and FS1, while adding a slate of men's and women's basketball games for the first time that will air on both networks.

1	YouTube launches Primetime Channels, a channel store—intended to compete with similar channel platforms operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku—offering an initial slate of 34 streaming services (including Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, Epix, AMC+ and ViX+) that can be purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub. Initially available only to U.S. users, the launch of Primetime Channels comes more than a month after YouTube TV began allowing users the option to subscribe to most of its premium add-ons (including a few not initially available on Primetime Channels such as HBO Max, Cinemax, MLB.tv and NBA League Pass) without signing up for the live TV service's base channel package.

3	Netflix launches an ad-supported version of its basic subscription plan in the U.S. and seven international countries, offering an average of four to five minutes of commercials per hour that will appear before and during titles, along with upgrading the basic plan's video quality (for both its ad-supported and existing ad-free versions) from 480i SD to 720p HD. (The "Basic with Ads" plan first launched in Canada and Mexico two days prior.) Subscribers of the ad-supported plan will not initially be able to view certain movies and TV series in Netflix's catalog due to licensing restrictions preventing ads from being inserted into those titles, and will not be able to download titles for offline viewing.	[258][259]
A change to the schedule in the 2022 World Series between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies due to rain earlier in the week leads to Game 5 being played directly opposite Amazon Prime Video's broadcast of a Thursday Night Football game featuring both cities' NFL teams (the Texans and Eagles respectively). Estimates from Nielsen Media Research show the baseball game drew an average of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football game, originally scheduled to air on the Fox O&Os in both markets (KRIV and WTXF, respectively) per NFL rules, moved to other stations. The Astros would go on to win their second World Series championship in franchise history two days later on November 5, defeating the Phillies, 4–1, in Game 6.	[260][261]
9	The 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards air on ABC from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, with Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning as hosts. Luke Combs (who won Entertainer of the Year, and Album of the Year for Growin' Up), Cody Johnson (who won Single of the Year and Music Video of the Year for "'Til You Can't") and Lainey Wilson (who won Female Vocalist of the Year and New Artist of the Year) were the night's top winners, with two awards each. Two-time Entertainer of the Year honoree Alan Jackson received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award.	[262][263]

After being operated under Paramount Media Networks (and its previous iterations) and jointly managed alongside MTV since its January 1985 launch, Paramount Global shifts oversight of VH1 to BET Media Group (under the purview of BETMG CEO Scott Mills). The network has had success in recent years with reality series aimed at African-American audiences (such as Basketball Wives, Black Ink Crew and Love & Hip Hop), along with incorporating Black sitcoms from the 1990s and 2000s (such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, My Wife and Kids and Martin) onto its schedule starting in the late 2010s. According to 2022 estimates by Nielsen, VH1 ranks second among U.S. cable networks in Black viewership, behind sister network BET.	[265]
Two years after Sling Media discontinued the device, the Slingbox becomes obsolete as all servers powering supported models are decommissioned. Created in 2002 by brothers Blake and Jason Krikorian, the pioneering streaming device allowed users to stream live TV content out-of-home via either a pay television service's set-top box or a DVR linked to the unit; this concept led to a complaint by Major League Baseball and a 2014 lawsuit by Fox (the latter was settled in 2016, after a federal court ruled Sling technology utilized by parent Dish Network's Hopper units did not violate copyright law) that contended the device illegally transmitted their programming online.	[266][267]
10	Conference USA announces a new five-year media rights deal with CBS Sports and ESPN that will run from the 2023–24 to 2028–29 academic years. CBS, as the primary rightsholder, will have right of first refusal to higher-profile football and men's and women's basketball games as well as broadcast rights to all of the conference's tournament championships; CBS and ESPN will also share rights to the conference's baseball, softball, and Olympic events. The new deal will see C-USA's football games during October shift to Tuesday and Wednesday nights to provide national expsoure. All C-USA broadcasts will be exclusive to the CBS Sports Network, while ESPN, in addition to televising selected events on its linear channels, will obtain streaming rights to C-USA sports for its ESPN+ streaming service.

11	Judy Woodruff announces she will step down as main anchor of the PBS NewsHour on December 30; she will remain with the public broadcaster as host of Judy Woodruff Presents: America at a Crossroads, a series of news specials examining America's political divisions that will air on PBS through the 2024 election cycle. Woodruff—who served as a correspondent from 1982 to 1993 and from 2006 to 2009—was appointed part-time anchor of the NewsHour in December 2009, before being promoted to co-anchor and co-managing editor alongside Gwen Ifill (as part of the first female anchor team on an American evening network newscast) in August 2013; she became sole anchor following Ifill's death from breast and endometrial cancer in November 2016. On November 16, chief correspondent Amna Nawaz and PBS News Weekend anchor/chief Washington D.C. correspondent Geoff Bennett—both of whom will remain in their respective roles as contributors for NBC News and MSNBC—were named to succeed Woodruff on the weeknight broadcasts effective January 2, 2023; this was followed on December 8 by Supreme Court correspondent John Yang being appointed to succeed Bennett as weekend anchor effective December 31.

15	NBC News suspends Today correspondent Miguel Almaguer pending an internal investigation, following a since-retracted November 4 report—citing an unnamed source, contradicting statements by prosecutors and police—that suggested Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, did not "declare an emergency" or try to leave when police responded to the couple's San Francisco home on October 28, and walked back to suspect David DePape, who allegedly attacked Paul with a hammer. (DePape has pled not guilty to federal and state charges of attempted murder, burglary, elder abuse and assault.) Conservative media personalities cited the report, suggesting that Pelosi allegedly knew his attacker.	[277][278]
16	As part of a "restructuring and realignment of leadership" in its entertainment division, CBS announces that Kelly Kahl will step down as the division's president at the end of the year, with Amy Reisenbach stepping up from her role as head of current programming to succeed him. Kahl departs after 26 years with CBS, spending much of that time developing and scheduling such shows as Survivor, CSI, and The Big Bang Theory for the network.	[279][280]
20	The 50th Annual American Music Awards airs on ABC from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, with Wayne Brady as host. Taylor Swift had the most wins of the night, winning all six categories for which she was nominated (including Artist of the Year), extending her existing record as the most-awarded artist in AMA history, with 40 total wins. Lionel Richie was honored with the Icon Award, and Yola was honored with the inaugural Song of Soul award.	[281][282]

21	Social media personality Charli D'Amelio and her pro partner Mark Ballas are crowned champions of Season 31 of Dancing with the Stars in what marked Len Goodman's final appearance on the show's judge panel. Goodman, who announced his departure on the semifinal broadcast of November 14, had served as lead judge on the Disney+ reality competition series since its debut on ABC in 2005; he died from bone cancer, which Goodman did not disclose at the time of his departure, six months later on April 22, 2023. Cheryl Burke, who had been with the show since 2006 and announced her departure on November 20, also ended her run as a pro partner with the season finale. (Burke and her Season 31 partner, former Good Morning America meteorologist Sam Champion, were eliminated fourth on October 10.)	[284][285]

22	A Robinson R44 news-gathering helicopter operated by CBS affiliate WBTV/Charlotte, North Carolina crashes around 12:20 p.m. ET near an intersection of Interstate 77 on the city's south side. WBTV early-evening meteorologist Jason Myers and helicopter pilot Chip Tayag, who were both on board the aircraft, are killed; three other people were taken to the hospital for observation, although no vehicles were hit on that section of I-77, as Tayag maneuvered the helicopter to crash in a grassy area just off the interstate's southbound lane.	[288][289]
24	A late Thanksgiving afternoon (4:30 p.m. ET) National Football League game between the NFC East divisional rivals New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys attracts 42 million total viewers on Fox and its streaming platforms, breaking a record for a singular NFL regular season game (41.5 million watched a Giants/San Francisco 49ers Monday Night Football game in December 1990). Earlier on this same day, a Buffalo Bills/Detroit Lions game on CBS attracts 31.63 million viewers, itself a record for the early (12:30 p.m. ET) NFL Thanksgiving time slot.	[290]

1	CNN announces the layoffs of up to around 400 staffers (including correspondents Alison Kosik, Martin Savidge, Alex Field and Mary Ann Fox, political analyst Chris Cillizza and several paid contributors) across its worldwide operations and cuts to selected programs as part of a broader effort by parent Warner Bros. Discovery to reduce operational costs by $1.1 billion. HLN bore the brunt of the changes, cancelling the morning newscasts Morning Express and Weekend Express (which were replaced on December 6 by a simulcast of CNN This Morning and reruns of Forensic Files, with the former fulfilling contractual obligations for HLN to air a net minimum of news content per week) and terminating their Atlanta-based production teams (including longtime Express anchor Robin Meade), while reassigning the network's operations from CNN Global to WBD U.S. Networks Group. (Sister channel Investigation Discovery, which operates under the latter subdivision, will add HLN's true crime programs to its schedule.) Express's cancellation marks the end of original live news programming on HLN after 40 years: the network debuted (as CNN2) in January 1982 with a 24-hour "news wheel" format that lasted until February 2005, when rolling news coverage was confined to daytime as it debuted a nighttime block of opinion and personality-based talk shows; HLN began scaling back news content outside of mornings in 2016 as it refocused around true crime programs. CNN will also begin relying more on experts over general contributors to discuss certain topical subjects, reduce or combine staff for its daytime and weekend programs, replace the CNN International late-afternoon newscast The Global Brief with a half-hour simulcast of CNN U.S.’s The Lead, and add unscripted programming onto CNN en Español’s lineup.

5	ABC News president Kimberly Godwin notifies staffers that T. J. Holmes and Amy Robach would be temporarily pulled from their anchor duties on GMA3: What You Need to Know, with substitutes anchoring the afternoon news program in the interim (correspondents Gio Benitez and Stephanie Ramos fill in on this date's broadcast). The move comes as the network determines the impact of a romantic relationship between Holmes and Robach that was revealed in a Daily Mail exposé published on November 30; ABC News leadership called the affair between the anchors—who separated from their respective spouses, attorney Marilee Fiebig and actor Andrew Shue, in August—"an internal and external disruption" though not a violation of company policy. By the end of January, both anchors would be exiting the network entirely.	[296][297][298]
Prior to this night's telecast of a home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at State Farm Arena, veteran Atlanta Hawks play-by-play announcer Bob Rathbun experiences convulsions and briefly loses consciousness on-air while co-hosting Bally Sports Southeast’s pregame show with color analyst Dominique Wilkins. Rathbun was treated by arena medical personnel for dehydration and taken to Emory University Hospital Midtown for evaluation. Hawks radio broadcaster Mike Conti would substitute for Rathbun on the regional sports network’s December 7 and December 9 broadcasts (against the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets, respectively).	[299][300]
6	The 48th People's Choice Awards airs simultaneously on NBC and E! from the Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport, with Kenan Thompson hosting. Among television nominees, Stranger Things had the most honors with three awards each (with the Netflix series being honored as "Show of 2022" and "Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show of 2022," while co-star Noah Schnapp was named "Male TV Star of 2022"). Also with three wins each, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness had the most wins among film nominees (the film itself winning "Movie of 2022", while Elizabeth Olsen was named "Action Movie Star of 2022" and "Female Movie Star of 2022") and Taylor Swift had the most wins among the music categories (Swift herself winning "Female Artist of 2022", with "Midnights" named "Album of 2022" and "Anti-Hero" named "Music Video of 2022").	[301][302]
Warner Bros. Discovery announces a deal with Amazon to resume selling HBO Max through Prime Video Channels starting that day; the add-on features ad-free access to the full HBO Max content library within the Prime Video app, along with live feeds of HBO's seven linear channels (which are not offered in the native HBO Max app). The agreement allows Prime Video to sell WBD's planned Max–Discovery+ combination service (see August 4 entry) when it launches in 2023. Under a deal signed in November 2020 that brought the HBO Max app to Fire tablets and Fire TV devices, Prime Video's original HBO add-on was removed in September 2021 as part of a direct-to-consumer strategy by former parent WarnerMedia that saw it shift away from selling HBO Max through third-party channel stores (resulting in those operated by Apple TV and Roku also removing their HBO add-ons) so it could control user data through its dedicated app, a move estimated to have cost HBO Max around five million subscribers.

8	Disney+ launches an ad-supported plan that offers an average of four minutes of commercials per hour before and during most titles, with prohibitions for political and alcohol advertising, any ads during preschool-targeted programs, and ads within kids’ user profiles. The "Disney+ Basic" plan costs US$7.99/month, the previous rate of the ad-free version (now known as "Disney+ Premium"), which concurrently received a US$3 price increase (along with corresponding increases for that plan's bundles with Hulu and ESPN+). However, as distribution deals do not yet cover the AVOD plan, users of the service's Roku and Windows apps could not subscribe to the "Disney+ Basic" plan and all bundles including it—among them, a standalone "duo" bundle with Hulu introduced with the ad-supported tier—at launch. The ad-supported plan will be rolled out to international markets during 2023.	[305][306]

ABC cancels its scheduled December 14 broadcast of A Very Backstreet Holiday, a Christmas variety special starring the musical group Backstreet Boys, after a woman filed a sexual battery lawsuit accusing BSB member Nick Carter of raping her and infecting her with HPV in a February 2001 incident, when the woman was 17 and Carter (who denies the allegations) was 21.

10–11	The 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards are held at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles; JoJo Siwa hosted the Creative Arts ceremony (held on the 10th) and Jack McBrayer hosted the main ceremony (held on the 11th). Heartstopper won four of Netflix’s 15 total awards (the most earned by a single linear network or streaming platform during the inaugural ceremony), including "Outstanding Young Teen Series," "Outstanding Lead Performance in a Preschool, Children's or Young Teen Program" (for Kit Connor) and "Outstanding Guest Performance in a Preschool, Children's or Young Teen Program" (for Olivia Colman); LeVar Burton received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work on PBS's Reading Rainbow and reading advocacy efforts for children. This ceremony was created in November 2021 to account for the heavily increased quantity and quality of children's and family programming, after all dayparts for children's programming fell under NATAS jurisdiction with the previous Daytime Emmys ceremony.

13	Major League Soccer announces a four-year deal with Fox Sports that will see Fox, FS1, and Fox Deportes simulcast 34 MLS-produced regular season broadcasts, eight playoff contests, and the MLS Cup championship game each season beginning in 2023. Fox will also share simulcast privilges on the Leagues Cup competition with Spanish language broadcaster TelevisaUnivision over the same four-year period. The deals assure that MLS will keep a presence on traditional television in the wake of its exclusive deal with Apple (see June 14 entry). It also brings to a close MLS' relationship with ESPN, which lasted from the league's first game in April 1996 through the 2022 season.	[310]
PBS, in its first third-party carriage deal with a free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service, reaches a multi-year agreement with Allen Media Group to distribute live feeds of the non-commercial public broadcaster's member stations and state/sub-regional networks, and its national children's network PBS Kids 24/7 over Local Now. Participating PBS stations will be added to the news and entertainment service's live TV platform through 2023. The deal expands upon a partnership between PBS and AMG that began on March 2, when PBS Digital Studios added its dedicated streaming network to Local Now's channel lineup. (PBS began offering live streams of its stations for free via its dedicated website and mobile app in 2020.)	[311][312]
19	NFL Network indefinitely suspends analyst Willie McGinest, pending investigation into his involvement in a December 9 fight at the Delilah nightclub in West Hollywood, in which the former New England Patriots and Cleveland Browns linebacker and several of his acquaintances violently assaulted a man sitting at a nearby table. The suspension came hours after McGinest's arrest on charges of committing assault with a deadly weapon; he was released later that day on a $30,000 bond.	[313][314]
21	Jim Gardner anchors WPVI-TV/Philadelphia's Action News for the final time, retiring from the ABC O&O after 46 years. Brian Taff replaced him as anchor of its 6:00 p.m. newscast the following day. Gardner joined WPVI as an assignment reporter in June 1976, and became solo anchor of the station's 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts in May 1977 (he stepped down from the latter broadcast on January 11, succeeded there by longtime anchor/reporter Rick Williams).	[315]
FuboTV and Diamond Sports Group reach an agreement to resume carriage of Bally Sports’s 19 regional networks on the vMVPD's base tier, ending a nearly two-year-long dispute that began in January 2020. (Hulu and YouTube TV removed the RSNs—then branded as Fox Sports Networks—ten months after they were dropped by Fubo, leaving DirecTV Stream as its only streaming distributor until the June 23 launch of the Bally Sports+ OTT service.) The deal comes amid uncertainty over Bally Sports's future, as Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL reportedly rejected an offer to jointly acquire the RSNs to help Diamond avoid bankruptcy (Diamond would likely seek to terminate Bally Sports's broadcast contracts, the majority of which were losing revenue, during bankruptcy proceedings) and majority owner Sinclair Broadcast Group disclosed in November that Diamond did not have enough financial resources to service its operations and $9 billion debt load beyond 2023 and had been generating cash flow at half of initial 2022 projections (with net losses of $1.2 billion and revenue of $684 million in Q3, respectively up 809% and down 10% from the year prior). Two days later, Fubo renewed a deal with Marquee Sports Network (which Sinclair co-owns with the Chicago Cubs) that would offer its national feed to subscribers outside the Chicago market.	[316][317]
[318][319]
22	The National Football League and Google announce that the league's NFL Sunday Ticket package will move exclusively to Google-owned YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels beginning with the 2023 season, making Sunday Ticket available for purchase as a standalone add-on for the first time. Reports indicate that Google will pay approximately $2 billion in annual rights fees under the initial seven-year agreement, which also extends YouTube TV's existing carriage agreements for NFL Network and NFL RedZone. The out-of-market sports package, which carries all Sunday afternoon games not telecast on a viewer's local CBS and Fox stations, had been carried on DirecTV since its launch in 1994.	[320][321]
ABC News fires freelance producer Kristen Hentschel after an NPR report published the day prior revealed that she had been hired by Montgomery, Alabama-based political consulting firm Matrix LLC as a paid operative, using her ABC credentials on at least three occasions to conduct unflattering pieces on Florida politicians whose positions on environmental regulations went against the interests of Florida-based corporations represented by Matrix (including among others, Florida Power & Light) and surveil corporate competitors of the firm's clients (such as the Southern Company). Hentschel had been working with the news division since 2016, primarily producing stories for Good Morning America.	[322][323]
31	The AMC Networks suite of linear and streaming channels (including AMC, IFC, SundanceTV, We TV, BBC America, BBC World News, and streaming networks AMC Premiere, El Gourmet and Mas Chic) are dropped from Fubo TV, as the vMVPD provider and AMC fail to renew a carriage agreement expiring on that date.	[324]
Meridian, Idaho-based vMVPD provider Evoca TV shuts down, after the company unsuccessfully attempted to secure additional funding to continue operations into 2023 (including a Change.org petition launched earlier in the month aimed at pressuring Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche owner Stan Kroenke, who also owns Denver-based regional sports network Altitude Sports and Entertainment, into investing in the provider). Launched in 2020 by founder/CEO Todd Achilles, Evoca TV—which operated in several markets in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Michigan—transmitted using the internet protocol-based ATSC 3.0 standard, offering a 60-channel lineup of local broadcast stations, selected cable-originated networks and RSNs over available broadcast spectrum.

Launches
Network	Type	Launch date	Notes	Sources
CBS News Miami	OTT streaming	January 24	CBS News and Stations launched CBS News Miami, utilizing news resources from and originating out of the Doral studios of CBSNS's Miami–Fort Lauderdale duopoly of CBS O&O WFOR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WBFS-TV. The service—the 13th CBS News Local property to launch—offers simulcasts and encores of WFOR/WBFS's newscasts, original content and additional newscasts produced exclusively for the service as well as national programming from the parent CBS News Streaming network.	[671]
Story Television	OTA multicast	March 28	On February 14, Weigel Broadcasting announced that it would launch Story Television on March 28. The network—which is Weigel's sixth national network and its seventh network overall (counting MeTV+, which has its availability limited to select Weigel stations), and the group's first multicast network to focus on unscripted programming—features historical and factual programming drawing primarily from the A&E Networks program library (mainly featuring series originated on A&E and History). In addition to carriage on Weigel-owned stations, Story Television was initially available on stations owned by Hearst Television, Marquee Broadcasting and Maranatha Broadcasting Company.	[672][673]
CNN+	OTT streaming	March 29	Announced in July 2021 by then-parent WarnerMedia News & Sports (now operating as CNN Global under Warner Bros. Discovery), the subscription companion streaming service to CNN—which is available as an add-on within CNN's apps and websites—features exclusive and original programs including talk shows providing analysis of news and current events, and specialty genre programming (including live shows anchored by Wolf Blitzer, Brian Stelter and Chris Wallace, and additional series hosted by Don Lemon, Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper) as well as original series and documentaries from CNN's library (such as Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown), and interactive programming.	[674][675]
The Weather Channel en Espaňol	May 2	Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the English network's launch, Allen Media Group launches a Spanish language version of The Weather Channel, operating as a 24-hour streaming network initially available on the network's website and mobile app and on co-owned AVOD service Local Now. The Weather Channel en Español offers local and national forecasts (including live and computer-automated forecast programs) as well as selected content from The Weather Channel and its climate and environment initiative/OTT network Pattrn.	[676]
The Weather Channel TV App	Also coinciding with TWC's 40th anniversary, Allen Media Group quietly launched The Weather Channel TV App, a direct-to-consumer streaming service—to be sold for $4.99/month—initially available for Roku and Xfinity Flex devices, and Amazon Fire TV, Android TV and Samsung Smart TV models. The service, which is structurally similar to TWC's TV Everywhere app, offers a live linear feed of the channel as well as local weather information (conceptually similar to TWC's interactive weather apps for DirecTV and Dish Network), on-demand clips from its forecast-based shows and unscripted original programming. It is unclear if the service is intended as a replacement for Weather Channel Plus, a broader subscription streaming service announced by AMG on June 30, 2021, and originally announced for a Q4 2021 launch, that was to offer content from The Weather Channel (including supplemental digital-only content) and more than 50 streaming news and entertainment channels (similar to those offered by Local Now), along with a likely merger of Entertainment Studios Networks's "SmartTV.com" Roku service (which offers streams and content from ESN's seven entertainment networks) that pre-dated AMG's purchase of The Weather Channel.	[677][678]
NESN 360	June 1	The New England Sports Network (NESN)—home to Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox and the NHL's Boston Bruins, among other sports teams in the region—becomes the first regional sports network to offer a standalone, direct-to-customer streaming service, featuring livestreams of NESN's main and overflow linear channels and a VOD library of its original studio and sports talk programs. Available only to customers in New England (due to MLB owning its own out-of-market streaming rights), the service is based on NESN's legacy app and TV platforms.	[679]
Bally Sports+	June 23 (in select markets);
September 26 (nationwide)	First announced in December 2020, Diamond Sports Group will soft-launch Bally Sports+, a direct-to-customer streaming service offering livestreams and market-specific studio and sports talk programs from regional Bally Sports networks, in five markets where the RSN group maintains in-market Major League Baseball broadcast rights (Kansas City, Detroit, Miami, Milwaukee, and Florida). The service—which will be based on the network's legacy app and TV platforms, initially on smartphones and tablet devices and subsequently becoming available on Roku devices by the 2022 MLB All-Star Game—expanded to the remainder of Bally Sports’ regional markets on September 26 (and is limited to customers residing within those service areas due to MLB owning its own out-of-market streaming rights). Optional bundles providing access to content from multiple Bally Sports networks serving markets where coverage of its individual linear channels overlap were made available to customers following the national launch.	[680][681]
NFL+	July 25	On May 25, Sports Business Journal reported the NFL planned to launch an SVOD streaming service in July, which would stream live in-market games as well as additional content (which may include radio broadcasts, podcasts and team-produced content) on smartphones and tablets. The launch of the service follows previous streaming agreements and formats with Yahoo! and Verizon, which expired at the end of the 2021 season.	[682][683]
AFN Now	September 20 (test launch at DOD Asia-Pacific bases);
November 7 (all DOD worldwide bases)	On July 19, the American Forces Network announced plans to launch an international streaming service, which would provide VOD content (consisting of network newscasts, sports, daytime and late-night talk shows, soap operas, children's programs, and other scripted and unscripted entertainment programming sourced from various U.S.-based television networks) and livestreams of AFN's linear networks free-of-charge to U.S. military personnel and their family members, military retirees, and Department of Defense civilian residents stationed or assigned overseas. On-demand availability of sports events—initially set to include Major League Baseball and NHL games, soccer matches, and NASCAR and IndyCar races—will be limited at launch, pending agreements with additional sports leagues. AFN Now soft-launched at DOD military installations in Japan and South Korea on September 20, before expanding to the remainder of the department's overseas installations when it formally launched on November 7.

name	Type	Conversion date	Notes	Source
Hillsong Channel	TBN Inspire	OTA multicast and cable/satellite/IPTV	January 1	Trinity Broadcasting Network renamed their joint venture network with Hillsong Church on January 1, a change announced in mid-November 2021, as the American Hillsong Church and Australian mother church have come under controversies involving their personnel, past and present, including the issues of former American church leader Carl Lentz's infidelity and allegations of founder Frank Houston's sexual abuse of children coming to light. Although only planned to be an American-only change, by April, TBN rebranded the network worldwide after Brian Houston resigned from the church after infidelity allegations were brought forward against him and dropped all Hillsong programming.	[689][690]
DIY Network	Magnolia Network	Cable and satellite	January 5	Chip and Joanna Gaines of Fixer Upper fame announced in an interview on the November 9, 2018, edition of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon they were returning to the fold of the former Scripps Networks Interactive networks now owned by Discovery, Inc. to launch a new full-time network based on their Magnolia lifestyle brand after taking a year's hiatus to consider other offers outside of HGTV. The Gaines will have the minority stake in the network. The launch was then oft-moved; Discovery announced on January 16, 2020, it would launch October 4 in the same year, but coronavirus-caused filming restrictions that would affect the network's debut lineup forced Discovery to delay the network's launch date indefinitely on April 21, 2020, with some programming launched as a part of Discovery+ starting on January 4, 2021, instead to build word-of-mouth for the linear network launch. More Magnolia Network content was placed on Discovery+ in mid-July of that year, with the transition of the wireline DIY Network to Magnolia Network occurring on January 5, 2022. After the Discovery properties were folded into Warner Bros. Discovery post-merger, the network was placed under the direct purview of Home Box Office, Inc. (All other Discovery networks were assigned to the Warner Bros. Discovery Networks unit within the company's corporate structure.)	[691][692]

[695]
CBSN	CBS News Streaming	OTT streaming	January 24	CBS News announced the rebrand of its CBSN streaming channel in November 2021, in an attempt to unify branding and newsgathering resources with the division. In addition to retaining daily rolling news blocks and content sourced from and simulcasts of CBS News programs (such as 60 Minutes and Face the Nation), the renamed CBS News Streaming Network incorporated additional original programming including The Uplift (hosted by CBS Mornings co-anchor Tony Dokoupil), a revival of Person to Person (hosted by Norah O'Donnell), Here Comes the Sun (a spin-off of CBS Sunday Morning), and The Dish (an extension of the cooking segments featured on CBS Saturday Morning, featuring that program's anchors). Concurrent with the national network's rebranding and the launch of its Miami service, CBS Television Stations concurrently rebranded its 12 existing local CBSN services under the CBS News Local umbrella.	[671]
Court TV Mystery	Ion Mystery	OTA multicast and cable/satellite	February 24	On February 23, the E. W. Scripps Company announced it would rebrand the true crime and mystery-focused multicast network as an extension of Ion Television effective February 24; Scripps considered the Ion branding more fitting for Mystery, which mainly offers scripted police procedural and mystery series as well as selected true crime documentary series, than that of co-owned Court TV as the main Ion network has aired similarly formatted scripted programs—as was the case, incidentally, during the latter years of Court TV's indirect cable predecessor—for most of its history. (Mystery—which, ironically, is not carried on the same station as the local Ion outlet in many of its markets as of the rebranding date—was among the five existing Scripps-owned subchannel networks that had their local affiliations moved to Ion-owned stations following the company's 2021 acquisition of Ion Media.)	[696]
IMDb TV	Amazon Freevee	OTT streaming	April 28	On April 13, Amazon announced it would rebrand its ad-supported VOD streaming service, IMDb TV, as Amazon Freevee on April 27. Branded as an extension of co-owned online film and TV database IMDb since its founding, the service was launched in January 2019 as IMDb Freedive, before adopting the IMDb TV moniker six months later. The rebrand ended up occurring a day later than announced.	[697]
GAC Family	Great American Family	Cable/satellite	August 20	On July 19, it was announced that GAC Media would rebrand as Great American Media as part of a corporate rebranding. As part of the rebranding, GAC Family and GAC Living were renamed as Great American Family and Great American Living, respectively.	[698]
GAC Living	Great American Living
TVG Network	FanDuel TV	September 1	Betfair, which had acquired the then-daily fantasy sports site FanDuel in mid-2018 and transferred the name to its American subsidiary (which included the Television Gaming, or TVG, networks, acquired from Macrovision in 2008), completes the process of re-branding and expanding the horse racing-specific networks to the FanDuel brand with the ongoing legalization of sports gambling across a number of states after the Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association decision struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 in 2018, with the oncoming 2022 NFL season. Both networks will continue to offer horse racing (along with some greyhound racing, which will only run in West Virginia by the end of 2022), with the addition of general sports gaming-specific discussion and debate shows added to the schedule, along with former Good Morning Football host Kay Adams hosting programs for the network. The dropping of the TVG brand also severs the remaining ties to founding owner TV Guide and released the network from a brand licensing agreement with that latter for that initialized name.	[699]
TVG2	FanDuel Racing
MSG+
MSG+2	MSG Sportsnet
MSG Sportsnet 2	September 26	The regional sports network (and its overflow)’s rebrand did not have an officially announced reason, but has been speculated to be to clear up customer confusion as the "Plus" suffix has seen become commonly used for streaming services.	[700]
Closures
Network	Type	End date	Notes	Sources
NickRewind	Programming block	January 31	TeenNick discontinued the overnight block of Nickelodeon's 1990s and 2000s original series on this date, replacing it with more recent Nickelodeon series already carried on its schedule (such as the original iCarly). Airing under multiple brands since its 2011 premiere, NickRewind had seen most of its programming shift to other ViacomCBS/Paramount streaming venues—including Pluto TV and Paramount+—since 2019.	[701]
RT America	Cable and satellite	March 3	The Washington-based arm of Russian state-funded news channel RT ceased operations in the wake of widespread opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with production partner T&R Productions discontinuing all live programming and laying off its entire staff. The shutdown occurred two days after its removal by DirecTV, co-owned U-verse TV, and Roku. Outside of its YouTube channel, Dish Network and its Sling TV service were RT America's only remaining linear distributors. (DirecTV had been considering removing RT America prior to the invasion once its contract expired mid-year, while Roku's initial removal of RT's apps in Europe was related to E.U. sanctions on Russian state media outlets.) Ora Media, one of the network's production partners, had also paused production of programs hosted by Dennis Miller (who was among the few on-air hosts to have resigned from the network in protest of the invasion) and William Shatner.	[702][703]
[464]
Fox Life	Cable and satellite	March 31	The American version of Fox Life, a Spanish-language network carrying mainly instructional home programming imported from Latin and South America, and Spanish-language dubs of American reality programming, was discontinued on this date, as The Walt Disney Company continued to wind down extraneous and declining assets from their acquisition of much of the assets of 21st Century Fox, especially those requiring payment of brand licensing fees to Fox Corporation. The network had launched as the U.S. version of Utilisma in 2001, becoming Fox Life in 2013; other international versions of Fox Life had already been wound down through 2020 and 2021 (five other regional versions in Western Europe and Japan were closed or relaunched under new brands and formats under News Corp/Fox ownership between 2009 and 2016), leaving its services in Greece and India as the only remaining Fox Life-branded networks in operation following the U.S. version's closure. The Latin American version of Fox Life, since rebranded as Star Life, also closed on the same date, along with several spin-off networks of National Geographic and Disney in the region.	[704][705]
CNN+	OTT streaming	April 28	Following its March 29 launch, the CNN streaming offshoot only attained 100,000 subscribers and 10,000 daily viewers after its first week. Executives with Discovery, Inc. (which merged with CNN parent company WarnerMedia to form Warner Bros. Discovery on April 8) were skeptical of CNN's estimated $1 billion investment in CNN+ through 2025, its broader strategy with the service (preferring to incorporate CNN content into HBO Max) and WarnerMedia's decision to launch it weeks before the merger's completion, citing Discovery's experience with launching similar niche streaming services prior to the 2021 launch of Discovery+. Most original programming would migrate over to either HBO Max or the linear CNN cable television channel. Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN Global division announced the shutdown on April 21; its cessation likely resulted in CNN+ becoming the shortest-lived American streaming service to date.	[706][707]
Real	Cable and satellite	July 15	As part of a transition to a new satellite and the reduction of overall bandwidth for The Erotic Networks, TEN owner New Frontier Media notified providers that it would discontinue its adult pay-per-view network Real on July 15. That network mainly featured unscripted and amateur sexual content.	[708]
Cinemax Go	TV Everywhere website service	July 31	On April 28, Warner Bros. Discovery notified providers that it would sunset the Cinemax Go service on July 31. The TV Everywhere platform—available to subscribers of Cinemax's linear channel tier—had been operating as a web-only service since May 2020, when WBD (then WarnerMedia) discontinued its mobile and smart TV apps as then-owner AT&T ramped up promotion of HBO Max over disparate TVE services. Most of the premium channel's previous original programming has already transitioned to HBO Max, along with its month-to-month film rights. On-demand content from the network remains available through its streaming add-ons and cable/satellite VOD service.	[709][710]
Black News Channel	Cable/satellite and OTT streaming	August 1	Launched in February 2020 as a linear/streaming news channel targeted at African-Americans, BNC—co-founded by former congressman J.C. Watts and media executive Bob Brillante—ceased operations on August 1, following Allen Media Group's acquisition of the network from majority shareholder Shahid Khan (see July 20 entry); its carriage agreements and satellite feed were transferred over to Allen's existing entertainment-focused OTA multicast network, TheGrio, which will incorporate news and commentary programs into its schedule to comply with BNC's carriage deals. BNC suspended live programming on March 25, after failing to meet payroll amidst a class action lawsuit filed in January against parent company BNC Services, LLC and the withdrawal of Khan's funding, and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 28. (Documentaries and other recorded content, including taped rolling news from as early as January, aired in the interim, before the network resumed a limited live daytime schedule on May 9.) BNC had suffered from persistently low viewership (it ranked 123rd out of 124 networks by average viewership according to 2021 Nielsen cable estimates, with a per-program average of 4,000 viewers), and underwent a series of layoffs and voluntary staff departures that had affected 120 employees since December 2021.	[190][472]
[711][191]
[192]
Digi-TV	OTA multicast	August 1	Citing "economic decisions beyond our control," Digi-TV ceased operations after 11 months, making it one of the shortest-lived American OTA multicast networks. Primarily airing on subchannels of stations owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision (among other affiliation agreements), Digi-TV featured scripted, reality, knowledge and lifestyle programs imported from Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.	[712][713]
Olympic Channel	Cable and satellite	September 30	On July 1, NBC Sports Group announced it was shutting down the U.S. version of Olympic Channel, which launched in partnership with the International Olympic Committee in July 2017 (replacing the general entertainment Universal HD, which had succeeded Bravo HD+ in 2004) to provide supplemental coverage of Olympic sports and qualifying events, along with original programming produced by the United States Olympic Committee and archival events. Its programming moves to other NBCUniversal-owned properties (including the Peacock streaming service), with a formal announcement concerning plans for its existing programming and broadcast rights expected in the fall.	[714][715]
G4	Cable and satellite	November 18	Citing low viewership, on October 16, Comcast Spectacor announced it would sunset G4 for the second time, almost a year after relaunching the gaming-focused pop culture network in November 2021, reportedly due to it failing to meet a $19 million annual revenue goal as well as very low viewership (it ranked last out of 124 networks by average viewership according to Q3 2022 Nielsen cable estimates, with both total day and prime time averages of 1,000 viewers); 45 employees were laid off as a consequence of the planned shutdown. The original incarnation of the network—which was co-developed as a venture of Comcast and NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment—launched in April 2002 (eventually merging with technology news network TechTV in May 2004) and operated for 12 years until it was shut down in December 2014.	[716][717]
[718][719]
[720]
Weatherscan	Cable and satellite	December 9	The Weather Channel's automated 24-hour cable and satellite channel Weatherscan was announced in October 2022 to be shutting down "no later than December 9". The service was dropped by multiple cable providers in preceding years due to declining viewership, the availability of smartphone weather apps, and the age of the technology that Weatherscan runs on.	[721]
Azteca América	OTA Spanish-language network	December 31	On October 21, INNOVATE Corp. announced it would shut down Azteca America on December 31, after 22 years of operation as a competitor to leading Spanish networks Univision and Telemundo. Prior to the announcement, INNOVATE (previously known as HC2 Holdings Inc. until 2021) had been selling most of the full-power stations operated by Azteca America, and began notifying affiliates and advertising partners of the network's planned closure. In addition, Azteca had entered into a content and co-production agreement with competitor Estrella TV that will see its news and entertainment programming blended onto that network's schedule.	[722][723]
Evoca	Subscription OTA network	December 31	Evoca, which operated on a network of ATSC 3.0 broadcasters that required a set-top box (based on Android) to decrypt the signal, closed down December 31, due to lack of funding. Its primary programming was to relay regional sports networks in smaller bundles (and thus lower prices) than cable, satellite or subscription over-the-top services. Evoca users, who are concentrated in the northwestern United States, will be allowed to keep their set-top boxes to use them for over-the-top service apps.	[724]

January 1	Salinas–Monterey–
Santa Cruz, California	KCBA	35.1	Fox	CW+	In December 2021, the News-Press & Gazette Company, owner of CBS affiliate KION-TV, purchased the rights to Fox network and syndicated programming held by KCBA (owned by Seal Rock Broadcasters and operated by Entravision Communications via an LMA). On January 1, KCBA's former intellectual unit—including the Fox affiliation—moved permanently to KION-DT2 (which retained the former's prior "Fox 35" brand and took over KCBA's former channel slots on local cable and satellite providers), while KCBA affiliated with The CW Plus, which relocated from the KION subchannel. The move resulted in the "Big Four" affiliations in the Salinas–Monterey market becoming controlled by only two commercial stations (Hearst-owned NBC affiliate KSBW has carried ABC over its DT2 feed since April 2011).

Antenna TV (secondary)	On January 20, Lilly Broadcasting—as part of affiliation renewals involving sister stations WENY/Elmira, New York and WSEE/Erie, Pennsylvania—announced that WZMQ would take over as the Upper Peninsula's CBS affiliate effective the following day, replacing Nexstar Media Group-owned WJMN-TV, which had carried the network's programming since February 1992, a byproduct of CBS's purchase of the station and Green Bay sister WFRV (of which WJMN served as a semi-satellite from its October 1969 sign-on until the CBS disaffiliation) from Midwest Television and Radio. WJMN affiliated with MyNetworkTV (previously on WZMQ) and added programming from Nexstar-owned Antenna TV to fill vacated overnight/early morning and weekend slots, while retaining most of its syndicated content and expanding its twice-daily evening newscasts to one hour each. CBS was relegated to WZMQ-DT2 (displacing both Start TV to WZMQ-DT4 and that subchannel's former Ion Television affiliation to the newly launched WZMQ-DT7), while adding morning weather inserts and evening newscasts produced primarily out of WSEE/WICU's Erie News Now operation in downtown Erie. (As MeTV remained on WZMQ's main feed, the switch marked the first known instance of a "Big Four" network maintaining a subchannel-only affiliation with a station primarily affiliated with a network intended for subchannel distribution.)

January 25	Alpena, Michigan	WBKB-TV	11.2	Fox/MyNetworkTV (moved to 11.4)	NBC	On January 24, Marks Radio Group announced that WBKB-DT2 would switch to NBC the following day. In turn, the subchannel's former Fox, MyNetworkTV and syndicated programming inventory was moved to a new DT4 subchannel of that station. The addition of NBC programming results in the "Big Four" affiliations in the Alpena market becoming controlled by the market's sole commercial station (WBKB-TV has been a primary CBS affiliate since its September 1975 sign-on and has also carried ABC on its DT3 feed since January 2013) and gave NBC local broadcast outlets in all 210 Nielsen DMAs. (The CW, affiliated with cable-only CW Plus outlet "WBAE", is the only remaining major network not available over-the-air within the Alpena DMA.) Previously, NBC programming had been provided to the area on cable and satellite via WTOM-TV/Cheboygan, which provides fringe over-the-air coverage to Alpena.	[730]
January 31	Honolulu, Hawaii	KIKU	20.1	ShopHQ	Multicultural Independent	On January 31, Allen Media Broadcasting took over ownership of KIKU, thus making the 39-year-old independent a sister station of ABC affiliate KITV. It also brought back its previous multicultural schedule of Japanese, Chinese, and Tagalog-language programming that was removed by its then-owner WRNN-TV Associates in favor of a controversial deal with ShopHQ started on July 1, 2021, to exploit their must-carry coverage across all their stations (a network already universally available through cable and satellite, and only 15 channels away from KIKU's channel position on Oceanic Spectrum, the state's major cable provider), which especially sparked outrage from local viewers and the station's own management (which will remain under Allen ownership) for removal of local-targeted programming in favor of a low-rated Mainland shopping network. In addition, KIKU will also serve as a secondary ABC affiliate for KITV, including simulcasting its newscasts (as well as adding an extra hour of its morning newscast) and regular syndicated programming.

On May 8, 2022, it moves onto becoming the market's O&O for MeTV, replacing WTTG-DT2, along with adding Weigel's other networks to its subchannels.	
June 1	Las Vegas, Nevada	KHSV	21.1	Heroes & Icons	On June 1, KLAS-TV moved Rewind TV from 8.4 to 8.2, and added Shop LC on 8.4, sending MeTV to KHSV's main subchannel, displacing Heroes & Icons and Decades to subchannels 21.2 and 21.6 respectively.	
June 3	Appleton–Green Bay, Wisconsin	WACY-TV	32.1	MyNetworkTV	Independent	On June 3, 2022, WACY disaffiliated with MyNetworkTV with no public notice, and returned to being an unaffiliated independent station for the first time since January 1995.	
July 28	Anaheim-Los Angeles, California	KDOC-TV	56.1	Independent	TCT	After the sale by Ellis Communications to TCT for $41 million and a farewell special, KDOC-TV becomes the Christian television network's West Coast flagship station, though its other subchannels remain associated with their previous networks.

The absence of any replacement affiliates for MyNetworkTV in Miami and Boston leaves the programming service with its largest loss of TV households by market rank.

MyNetworkTV (secondary)	On October 24, Marquee Broadcasting-owned NBC affiliate WHIZ-TV, the only full-power commercial station in the small Zanesville market, moved its DT2 subchannel's affiliation Cozi TV to DT3 and announced that DT2 would be joining Fox and MyNetworkTV effective November 14 (DT2 simulcasted WHIZ-TV's main subchannel in the interim). This leaved Glendive, Montana, the smallest media market in the country, as the only Nielsen DMA without either a locally based Fox affiliate. Previously, Fox was shown on the DT3 subchannel of ABC affiliate WSYX, and before that WTTE, while WSYX's DT2 subchannel showed MyNetworkTV, all in nearby Columbus, had served the Zanesville area on local cable and satellite systems.

WYCC	20.1	First Nations Experience	Chicago, Illinois	June 1	Chicago's former official second member station for PBS, WYCC, sees its license returned by its owners and signs off permanently. The station, which had launched as WXXW by Window to the World Communications (founders and owners of primary PBS station WTTW) in 1965, had a history of 'secondhand' status in the Chicago market, being neglected in its first WTTW ownership and going silent in 1974 due to transmitter disrepair. Sold to the City Colleges of Chicago in 1983, it returned to the air as a city-focused educational service with a popular afternoon homework helpline program, other local programming, and British import programming and secondary PBS content filling its schedule, but also faced the whims of Chicago politics, with mayors and city councils varying their funding over the years. It (along with Northwest Indiana PBS member station WYIN) also faced continued hostility from Window to the World, which continually angled to be the exclusive PBS member station for Chicagoland and disallowed any attempt by either station to diversify and compete, using their role as a national programming provider to stop any such attempts for both stations.
By 2017, the City Colleges sold WYCC's spectrum during the FCC spectrum auction for nearly $16 million, intending for it to sign off by the end of 2017, but was pressured to sell to another party to preserve its format. Window to the World re-acquired the station's license by March 2018, entering into a technical channel sharing agreement with WTTW to keep WYCC alive, but did not rehire any WYCC staff, and soon reduced it to an unpublicized passthrough of the FNX Native American-focused network. WTTW ran into its own funding issues during the pandemic and decided to relinquish the WYCC license to save the money being used for WYCC's regulatory compliance, along with the FNX affiliation. In technicality, the launch of World Channel on WYCC's former spectrum share as WTTW-DT5 replaced it.

Notes
 With its move to the streaming service, first-run episodes of Days of Our Lives—which had been available to its free and paid users as an NBC program—will be paywalled to subscribers of Peacock's premium tiers. Days will become only the third soap opera to move from broadcast to streaming (following the short-lived revivals of All My Children and One Life to Live—which ended their linear runs on ABC in September 2011 and January 2012, respectively—on Hulu in 2013), and its departure from NBC leaves CBS’s The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, and ABC’s General Hospital as the only remaining soap operas carried on U.S. broadcast television.
 YouTube TV's HBO Max add-on consists of in-app access to live feeds of the seven linear HBO channels and VOD content from the premium channel, and provider login access to the HBO Max app. (The vMVPD also offers a standalone HBO add-on without login access to HBO Max, which requires a subscription to its base channel package to purchase.)
 In the Jacksonville DMA, CBS affiliate WJAX—which Cox operates under a joint sales agreement with owner Hoffman Communications—was not involved in the dispute as it is covered by a separate carriage contract from that of virtual duopoly partner WFOX.
 The HBO add-on originally sold through Prime Video from December 2016 until its removal had offered in-app access to the network's VOD library content and live streams of its linear channels; authenticated log-in access to the standalone HBO Max app was also made available to subscribers of the add-on as part of a December 2020 agreement that also made the app available for download on Amazon Fire and Fire TV devices. The original add-on’s addition to Prime Video Channels was part of a broader agreement reached between Time Warner and Amazon in 2016 that also allowed Prime Video subscribers to be able to purchase sister premium service Cinemax as a separate add-on.
 Netflix premiered 13 of 22 of the previous season's episodes on June 15 and October 15, 2021 prior to becoming the series's official home.
 Renamed Meet the Press Now with the move
 Just like with ESPN's Monday Night Football broadcasts, a local broadcast syndication simulcast is mandatory for each team's market each week. A limited number of games will remain exclusive to NFL Network due to terms in the network's retransmission consent contracts with cable, satellite, and subscription over-the-top providers.
 Early release on March 6 on Discovery+
 Early release on May 22 on AMC+
 The third and final season of Fancy Nancy received an early, full release on Disney+ on November 12, 2021.
 On January 21, Nexstar Media Group announced it had renewed the affiliation contracts of its 39 CBS stations, including those of WFRV and 11 other affiliates that continued to carry the CBS schedule on day-to-day status after their prior affiliation agreements expired on December 31, 2021 amidst the continuing negotiations without a temporary extension.[729] Of the 13 Nexstar-run CBS stations that had their contracts lapse overall, WJMN (which was notified of the move of CBS to WZMQ only three days before the switch) was the only station that did not remain with the network.

The Sixth Labour Government has governed New Zealand since 26 October 2017. It is headed by Chris Hipkins, the Labour Party leader and prime minister.

On 1 August 2017, Jacinda Ardern succeeded Andrew Little as both leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition.[1] Following the 2017 general election held on 23 September, the New Zealand First party held the balance of power between the sitting centre-right National Party government, and the left bloc of the Labour and Green parties. Following negotiations with the two major parties, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters announced on 19 October 2017 that his party would form a coalition government with Labour.[2] That same day, Green Party leader James Shaw announced that his party would give confidence and supply support to the 55-seat Labour–NZ First government.[3] The Greens' support, plus the coalition, resulted in 63 seats to National's 56—enough to ensure that Ardern maintained the confidence of the House. Three years later, Labour went on to a landslide victory in the 2020 general election with 50% of the vote and 65 seats, an outright majority of the 120 seats in the House.[4]

On 19 January 2023, Ardern announced her resignation and that she would not stand for re-election in the 2023 general election.[5] Hipkins succeeded her as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party on 25 January 2023.[6]

Main article: 2017 New Zealand general election
The general election on 23 September 2017 saw the New Zealand First party hold the balance of power between National and the centre-left bloc of Labour and the Green Party. Following several weeks of negotiations with both National and Labour, New Zealand First announced on 19 October 2017 it would seek to form a minority coalition government with Labour. Confidence-and-supply support from the Greens, negotiated separately with Labour, enables the Government to have a majority in the House of Representatives.[2][3] During the coalition-forming negotiations, Labour agreed to drop its proposed water tax on farmers as part of its agreement with New Zealand First.[7] In return, NZ First agreed to drop their demand for referendums on overturning New Zealand's anti-smacking ban and abolishing the Māori electorates.[8][9] The Greens consented to a confidence and supply agreement with Labour and New Zealand First in return for several concessions, including: a referendum on legalising cannabis, treating alcohol and drugs as a health issue, net zero emissions by 2050 and requiring a climate impact assessment analysis for all legislation[10][11]

NZ First, Labour and Green ministers with the Governor-General, October 2017
2017
In November 2017, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker announced that their government would continue participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations despite opposition from the Green Party.[12][13] That same month, Ardern offered to resettle 150 of the asylum seekers from the former Manus Regional Processing Centre in New Zealand, but was rebuffed by the Turnbull Government in Australia.[14][15] On 20 November, Ardern reaffirmed the Government's commitment to re-enter Pike River Mine with the goal of completing mine recovery by March 2019.[16] Minister for Pike River Re-Entry Andrew Little also announced the creation of the Pike River Recovery Agency.[17]

On 12 December, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would be ending National Standards in schools. This decision was welcomed by the teachers' and principals' unions but opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties.[18][19] On 20 December, the Government established a Tax Working Group consisting of several academics, businesspeople, and senior civil servants under the leadership of former Finance Minister Michael Cullen with the goal of reforming the taxation system and alleviating the country's housing crisis.[20] On 22 December, Prime Minister Ardern and Foreign Minister Winston Peters opposed US President Donald Trump's move to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel at the United Nations General Assembly and reiterated New Zealand's support for the Two State Solution.[21]

2018
On 19 January 2018, Ardern revealed that she was expecting her first child in June, and that Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters would serve as Acting Prime Minister while she took maternity leave for a period of six weeks.[22][23] In mid-February 2018, the Government introduced legislation to stop the creation of new charter schools but to allow the 11 existing schools to continue operating while they negotiated options with the Ministry of Education; with Prime Minister Ardern suggesting that the existing schools could convert to "special character" schools.[24][25] In early-March 2018, during a state visit to Samoa, Ardern stated that New Zealand would be seeking to shift away from a 'donor, recipient relationship' with Pacific Islands nations in favour of forming partnerships with these states and introduced a NZ$10 million aid package to Samoa with NZ$3 million going to disaster relief following Cyclone Gita and the rest being allocated to social developmental and education projects.[26][27][28]

On 8 March 2018, Trade Minister Parker stated the government's intention of ratifying the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, an amended version of the TPP, in Chile.[29] On 3 April 2018, Ardern and Transport Minister Phil Twyford introduced the Government's ten-year draft land transport plan which included a proposed 9-12% a litre fuel tax hike, a proposed 20% fuel tax hike in Auckland, boosting public transport funding by 46%, cutting state highway funding by 11%, and allocating $4 billion over the next ten years to establish rapid transit including light rail with an initial focus on Auckland.[30][31] On 11 April 2018, Attorney General David Parker announced a government inquiry into allegations that the New Zealand Special Air Service had committed war crimes against Afghan civilians during Operation Burnham while stationed in Afghanistan.[32][33]

On 11 April, Attorney-General David Parker announced a government inquiry into the New Zealand Special Air Service's actions during Operation Burnham in Afghanistan in August 2010.[32][34] On 12 April, the government banned future offshore oil and gas exploration in New Zealand. In addition, Energy Minister Megan Woods clarified that the thirty existing exploration permits would still continue and be unaffected by the ban. New Zealand has 27 oil fields with most being located in the Taranaki Basin. The ban on future oil and gas exploration was part of a coalition agreement between the Labour and Green parties. The decision was welcomed by Greens Co-Leader James Shaw, Greenpeace and Forest & Bird but was criticised by the Mayor of New Plymouth Neil Holdom, and the opposition National and ACT parties.[35][36][37]

On 19 April, Little entered the Pike River Mine portal with two Pike Family representatives to demonstrate that a safe re-entry was possible. He reiterated the Government's promise to re-enter the drift in order to recover evidence and the remains of the deceased miners.[38] On 4 May, Ardern and Housing Minister Phil Twyford stated that the Government would be investing NZ$100 million into combating homelessness. This initiative included investing NZ$37 million into building 1,500 shorter term-homes and NZ$63 million into the Housing First programme; which involves finding permanent homes for vulnerable families and treating addiction and mental health issues.[39][40][41] On 17 May, Finance Minister Grant Robertson released the 2018 New Zealand budget, allocating NZ$2.8 billion in operational funding and NZ$3.8 billion in capital funding to the 2018 New Zealand Budget.[42][43]

On 11 June, the Labour-led coalition government had abandoned efforts to appeal the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010 (the so-called three-strikes law) due to internal opposition from NZ First.[44][45][46] Ardern confirmed that she would temporarily relinquish her duties to Winston Peters, following the birth of her child, for a period of six weeks. Peters became Acting Prime Minister on 20 June 2018, when Ardern went into labour. Her six-week maternity leave concluded on 2 August 2018.[47][48]

On 1 July 2018, the government announced that it would be implementing its Families Package, which had been signed into law on 15 December 2017.[49][50] The Families Package would increase paid parental leave from 22 weeks to 26 weeks from July 2020; introduce a Winter Energy Payment for beneficiaries and pensioners; paying $60-a-week to low and middle-income families with babies and toddlers; reinstating the Independent Earner Tax Credit; and increasing benefit allowances for orphans, unsupported children, and foster carers.[49][51] The Families Package was criticised by the opposition National finance spokesperson Amy Adams for increasing taxation. In response, Finance Minister Grant Robertson countered that the Government was investing in low and middle-income New Zealanders rather than the "top 10% of earners". Meanwhile, Child Poverty Action Group Susan St John said that "the changes were long overdue but did not go far enough".[49][52]

On 3 July, the New Zealand Educational Institute, the national trade union body for primary teachers, announced that teachers and principals would go on strike on 15 August after the Ministry of Education rejected their demand for a 16% pay rise.[53][54] On 12 July 2018, 30,000 nurses went on strike for 24 hours; the first such nationwide strike in thirty years. The industrial action came after the New Zealand Nurses Organisation rejected the government's offer of a 12.5% pay rise.[55] A few days earlier, 4,000 workers at Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment stopped work for two hours to protest their salaries, their first industrial action in 22 years.[56] On 7 August, nurses voted to accept an offer by DHBs that included pay rises between 12% and 16%, an earlier new pay step for senior nurses, the implementation of Capacity Demand Management (CCDM); and a commitment to pay equity by the end of next year.[57][58][59]

On 14 August, the Government passed the Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018 which bans the sale of existing homes to non-residents as a means of easing the housing shortage in New Zealand. Australians and Singaporean nationals were made exempt from this ban due to free trade rules. The Bill was supported by Labour and its coalition partners New Zealand First and the Greens but was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties. It passed its third reading on 14 August by 63 votes to 57 votes.[60][61]

On 30 August 2018, Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government was investing into supporting "rapid response teams" in emergencies following a critical Ministerial Technical Advisory Group's (TAG) review of the Government's unsatisfactory responses to the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake and the 2017 Port Hills fires.[62][63]

By September 2018, all twelve existing charter schools had been successfully converted into state integrated and special character schools.[64][65] In early October 2018, the Government formally established a new government department called the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development to manage housing and urban development issues. This department is headed by Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford.[66][67]

In late November 2018, Prime Minister Ardern and Health Minister David Clark announced that the Government would reduce the costs of visits to the general practitioner as part of their Budget 2018. These policies include extending free doctors' visits to resident children under the age of thirteen and lowering Community Service Card holders' fees by $20-$30 per visit.[68][69]

On 11 December 2018, the Government passed a law, amending the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 to allow terminally ill patients to use marijuana for palliative care. The new law was supported by all coalition parties but was opposed by the opposition National Party, which argued that it would legalise recreational cannabis consumption.[70][71] On 18 December, the Government announced that it would be holding a binding referendum on legalising the personal use of cannabis during the 2020 general election.[72][73]

On 19 December, the Government announced that it would be voting in favour of the UN's Global Compact for Migration. Foreign Minister Peters justified the decision on the grounds the Compact was not legally binding and would not hinder New Zealand from setting its own migration policies. The Government's decision was criticised by the opposition National Party, which claimed it would violate New Zealand's sovereignty.[74]

2019
In mid-January 2019, Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford admitted that the government would be unable to meet its target of building 1,000 KiwiBuild homes by 1 July, with only 33 homes being built as of 23 January. The minister estimated that the government would be able to build only 300 houses by the 1 July deadline.[75][76] That same month, it was reported that the KiwiBuild Head Stephen Barclay had resigned following disagreements with the Housing Minister and criticism from Housing and Urban Development employees over his leadership and management. Barclay announced that he was filing a "constructive dismissal case" against the ministry for breaching his privacy.[77][78][79][80]

On 3 February 2019, Prime Minister Ardern and Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones announced that the government had allocated NZ$100 million from its Provincial Growth Fund to supporting Māori economic development by providing access capital. It also allocated another NZ$27 million to improving transportation and the horticulture sector around Kaipara District.[81][82]

In mid-February, Education Minister Chris Hipkins proposed merging the country's sixteen polytechnics into a "NZ Institute of Skills and Technology" in response to deficits and a slump in domestic enrolments. This proposed NZ Institute would also take over the enrolment and management of apprentices and industry trainees from the country's eleven industry training organisations. In addition, the government will create a new vocational funding system. The Tertiary Education Union, Employers and Manufacturers Union, and the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce have expressed tentative support for the government's proposals. However, the opposition National Party's Education spokesperson Shane Reti criticised the proposed merger, claiming that it would entail the centralisation of decision-marking in the vocational education sector.[83][84] In response to the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019, Hipkins extended the polytechnic submission timeframe to 5 April 2019.[85]

On 5 March 2019, the New Zealand Parliament unanimously passed the Crimes Amendment Bill, which repealed Section 123 of the Crimes Act.[86] This bill had been introduced the previous year by Minister of Justice Andrew Little and sought to overturn the law banning the publication of any "blasphemous libel" in New Zealand. The amendment received support from both government and opposition parties as well as the Ministry of Justice, the Human Rights Commission, and the New Zealand Council of Civil Liberties. The bill received the royal assent on 11 March 2019 and came into force the following day.[87][88][89]

Following the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the government would be reforming New Zealand's gun laws, including a proposed ban on semi-automatic firearms.[90][91] Attorney General David Parker said that the government would consider legislation dealing with semi-automatic weapons and other issues.[92] On 21 March 2019, Ardern announced that the government would ban all semi-automatic firearms and assault rifles. She also clarified that the government would be introducing a buy-back scheme to remove all prohibited firearms from circulation.[93][94][95]

On 10 April, the government's Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019 passed its third reading, banning semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts. The Arms Amendment Act 2019 was supported by all parties except the opposition ACT Party's sole MP David Seymour.[96][97][98] In addition, the government announced an amnesty and buy-back scheme for prohibited firearms and components.[99][100][101]

On 17 April, Prime Minister Ardern announced that it would not be introducing a capital gains tax, citing disagreements among coalition parties over implementing such a tax. The Prime Minister pledged that under her leadership capital gains tax would not be introduced in the future. Finance Minister Robertson said that the Government would still explore options for targeting land speculation, land banking, and vacant land. Opposition Leader Bridges criticised the capital gains tax debate for wasting taxpayer funds and undermining business and investor confidence.[102][103][104][105]

On 2 May 2019, Education Minister Hipkins announced that the Government would be investing NZ$95 million to train 2,400 new teacher trainees through increased scholarships and placements, new employment-based teacher education programmes, and iwi-based scholarships over the next four years to address the teaching shortage. Post Primary Teachers' Association President Jack Boyle responded that the Government's measures were insufficient to deal with the teachers shortage, which he attributed to insufficient salaries, high workloads, and a high attrition rate among new teaching graduates. National Party Education spokesperson Nikki Kaye claimed that the Government's spending would not address the teaching shortage while ACT MP David Seymour opined that the money would be better spent on increasing teaching salaries.[106][107][108]

On 8 May 2019, the Government introduced the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill to Parliament.[109] The Government's Zero Carbon Bill passed its first reading on 22 May 2019. The opposition National Party supported the bill despite its concerns about the bill's methane targets.[110][111]

On 21 May 2019, mine re-entry efforts into the Pike River Mine began. Recovery and forensic operations are expected to take several months.[112][113][114][115]

On 30 May 2019, the Government released its first Wellbeing Budget. Key provisions included creating a new frontline mental health service, investing $40 million in suicide prevention services, stationing nurses at secondary schools, building 1,044 new homes, investing $320 million into specialist services to address family and sexual violence, investing $200 million into apprenticeships and vocational training programs, investing $1 billion into KiwiRail, and investing $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion into repairing hospitals and schools respectively.[116][117] The release of the Wellbeing Budget was complicated by the accidental publication two days earlier of high-level documents on a test website that was not supposed to be publicly available. The opposition National Party gained access to these documents and criticised the budget. This leak initially raised allegations of hacking and was referred to the police before a senior Treasury official confirmed that the leak had been accidental. Opposition Leader Bridges also criticised the Government's handling of the data leak and called for the resignations of Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Treasury Secretary Gabriel Makhlouf.[118][119][120]

On 10 June 2019, Prime Minister Ardern, Foreign Minister Peters, and Defence Minister Ron Mark announced that the New Zealand Government would be withdrawing New Zealand military forces from Iraq in June 2020. The New Zealand Defence Force had dispatched a non-combat Building Partner Capacity (BPC) training mission to help Australian forces train Iraqi Security Forces at the Taji Military Complex in Iraq in support of the US-led coalition efforts to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq.[121] The number of NZ military personnel would be reduced from 95 to 75 by July 2019, and 45 from January 2020.[122] However, NZDF personnel would remain in Afghanistan for at least another 18 months. Prime Minister Ardern also announced that the number of NZDF personnel in Afghanistan would be reduced from 13 to 11 by March 2020.[123] While National has cautiously supported the Government's policy, the party's defence spokesperson Mark Mitchell has voiced concerns that the Iraqi withdrawal was too soon.[122]

On 11 June 2019, Defence Minister Mark released the Government's $20 billion Defence Capability Plan 2019, which will cover the NZ Defence Force's budget for the next eleven years. Key items include investing NZ$3.5 billion for new and replacement naval vessels and maritime helicopters, NZ$2.5 billion worth of upgrades for the Royal New Zealand Air Force, bolstering New Zealand Army troop numbers from 4,700 to 6,000 by 2035, and launching satellite-based surveillance systems. National's defence spokesperson Mitchell has supported the Government's Defence Capability Plan but disagreed with the Government's decision to bypass the tender process for new Lockheed C-130 Hercules jets.[124][125]

On 20 June, Finance Minister Robertson and Police Minister Nash launched the Government's six-month firearms buy-back amnesty, which would run until 20 December. The Government allocated NZ$200 million to the firearms buy-back scheme. Licensed firearms owners will be eligible for the scheme. There are four collection options for the government's buy-back scheme: large-scale events at centralised community locations; handing over items at approved gun dealers; bulk pick-ups by Police; and at Police stations.[126][127]

On 26 June 2019, the primary teachers' union, the New Zealand Educational Institute, voted to accept the Government's NZ$1.5 billion collective agreement. This collective agreement contains a new, unified pay scale that will restore parity across the state schooling sector. Key provisions include raising all teachers' base salaries by 18.5% by July 2021 and making Q3+, Q4, and Q5 teachers eligible for a new top salary of NZ$90,000. While primary teachers voted to accept the Government's offer, primary principals have rejected the offer, demanding better pay and working conditions.[128][129][130] On 28 June 2019, the secondary teachers' union, the Post Primary Teachers' Association, voted by a majority of 65% to accept the Government's pay offer, which included a lump sum of NZ$1,500 and a 3% pay rise in July and over the next three years.[131][132][133]

On 27 June 2019, Prime Minister Ardern announced a cabinet reshuffle. She split the housing portfolio into three positions; appointing Megan Woods as Minister of Housing, Kris Faafoi as Associate Minister of Housing, and Phil Twyford as Minister of Urban Development. In addition, Grant Robertson was appointed as Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission; Jenny Salesa as Minister of Customs; and Peeni Henare became Minister of Civil Defence. In addition, several Labour Members of Parliament were appointed to various parliamentary positions including assistant speaker, senior government whip, and parliamentary private secretaries.[134][135]

On 17 July, the Government released its plan on integrating drones into the country's transportation system, entitled Taking Flight: an aviation system for the automated age. Transportation Minister Phil Twyford said that drones "could deliver economic benefits by doing tasks that are time intensive, expensive, and risky – such as monitoring crops, inspecting power lines and helping with emergency operations". As of 2019, there are 77,000 drones in New Zealand with many being used in the forestry, agriculture, and conservation sectors.[136][137][138]

On 22 July, Prime Minister Ardern announced a second series of gun reforms which including creating a national firearms register, tighter restrictions on who can obtain a firearms licence, and a ban on overseas visitors buying guns in New Zealand but still allowing them to bring personal firearms into the country. Police Minister Stuart Nash announced that the Government would be drafting a new bill the following month to codify these proposed reforms into law.[139][140] The New Zealand Police's union, the Police Association, has advocated the establishment of a national gun register and welcomed the government's proposed raft of gun reforms.[141]

On 26 July, the New Zealand Educational Institute's kindergarten teacher members voted to accept an agreement with the Ministry of Education that will put early childhood education teachers' pay on par with primary and secondary school teachers. Early childhood education teachers will receive a pay rise of at least 18.5% by July 2020, NZEI members will receive a lump sum of NZ$1,500, and there will be an increase in the head and senior teachers' allowances.[142][143]

On 1 August, the Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would merge all 16 institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs) into a single entity in April 2020. In addition, Hipkins announced that the Government would replace all 11 industrial training organisations (ITOs) with between four and seven workforce development councils that would be set up by 2022 to influence vocational education and training. While polytechnics have been cautiously optimistic about the changes despite concerns about losing their autonomy to a national organisation, ITOs have opposed these changes, arguing that they would wreak an already working system. National's tertiary education spokesperson Shane Reti criticised the proposed changes as a "step backward" that would lead to job losses.[144][145][146]

On 4 August, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the Government would be investing NZ$25 million in purchasing 12 new radiation machines over the next three years. Funding for this will come from the $1.7 billion the Government invested in hospital and health facilities as part of its Wellbeing Budget.[147][148][149]

On 5 August, Justice Minister Andrew Little announced a new abortion reform law that would remove abortion from the Crimes Act 1961 and allow women unrestricted access to abortion within the 20 week gestation period. Other changes include allowing women to self-refer to an abortion service, ensuring that health practitioners advise women about counselling services, establishing safe areas around abortion facilities, and requiring conscientious objecting doctors to inform women about their stance and alternative services.[150][151][152][153] Despite initially ruling out a referendum, Labour's coalition partner New Zealand First has since supported calls for a referendum on abortion reform. National Party leader Simon Bridges has indicated that he would support a Select Committee considering the bill.[154][155] On 8 August, the Government's abortion reform bill passed its first reading by 94 to 23 votes. Politicians followed a conscience vote instead of voting according to party lines.[156][157][158]

In mid August 2019, the Associate Housing Minister Kris Faafoi and Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni announced that the Government would be launching a NZ$54 million program to tackle homelessness in New Zealand. This includes investing $31 million in recruiting 67 intensive case managers and navigators to work with homeless people and a further $16 million in the Sustaining Tenancies Programme. This funding complements the Government's Housing First programme.[159][160] On 29 August, Prime Minister Ardern and Children's Minister Martin announced that the Government will be launching a free lunch program. The trial program will begin with 5,000 primary and intermediate-aged school pupils at 30 schools in Rotorua and Hawke's Bay with plans to extend it to 21,000 pupils in 120 schools by early 2021.[161][162]

On 30 August, the Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter announced the establishment of a National Health Coordination Centre in Auckland in response to a measles outbreak.[163] As of 30 August, there were 759 reported cases of measles in Auckland, 41 in the Canterbury Region, and four in the Otago and Southland regions.[164] On 1 September, Prime Minister Ardern and Health Minister Clark announced that it would create a national Cancer Control Agency by December 2019 and would also invest NZ$60 million into the national drug purchasing company Pharmac as part of a ten-year cancer action plan.[165][166][167]

On 4 September, Housing Minister Megan Woods announced that the Government was revising its KiwiBuild programme, admitting that the initial goal had been "overly ambitious" and that houses had been built in places with little demand. Changes have included scrapping its target to build 100,000 houses over the next ten years, reducing government-back deposits for housing loans from 10% to 5%, and introducing progressive home ownership schemes including shared ownership and rent to buy initiatives.[168][169]

On 10 September, Prime Minister Ardern and Health Minister Clark announced the establishment of a Suicide Prevention Office to address the country's suicide rate. Key changes include shifting from a mental health service model to a community-based one and supporting people bereaved by suicide. The Suicide Prevention Office will initially be under the oversight of the Ministry of Health but there are plans to make it a standalone government service.[170][171]

On 12 September, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the teaching of New Zealand history will be made compulsory in all New Zealand primary and secondary schools by 2022. Key topics include the arrival of Māori people, European colonisation, the Treaty of Waitangi, immigration to New Zealand, the country's evolving national identity during the 19th and 20th centuries, and New Zealand's involvement in the Pacific. Education Minister Hipkins also confirmed that the Education Ministry would work with historical and curriculum experts, the Māori and Pacific communities, students, parents, and other interested parties. Historically, the teaching of New Zealand history has been neglected in schools in favor of European history. Hokotehi Moriori Trust chair Maui Solomon welcomed the Government's announcement, saying that it would help dispel myths about the Moriori being a separate Melanesian people who were displaced by the Māori.[172][173]

On 13 September 2019, Prime Minister Ardern and Police Minister Nash announced that the Government would be introducing an Arms Legislation Bill in late September. The new bill would introduce an online firearms register to stop the flow of guns into the criminal underworld. The opposition National Party, which had seen a leaked draft of the bill the previous month, and gun lobby groups claimed that the bill would hurt firearm owners and gun clubs.[174][175][176] The Government's Arms Legislation Bill passed its first reading. Labour, the Greens, and NZ First supported the bill but it was opposed by the National and ACT parties.[177][178]

In early October 2019, Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway announced that the Government would be scrapping a requirement for African and Middle Eastern refugee applicants to have relatives who were residing in New Zealand. Despite increasing the African and Middle Eastern refugee quotas from 14% to 15%, New Zealand's refugee resettlement program would still focus on resettling refugees from the Asia-Pacific region, which is allocated 50% on the annual refugee quota. Refugee advocate Murdoch Stephens, World Vision, and the Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon had previously criticized the previous policy as discriminatory.[179][180][181]

On 8 October 2019, the New Zealand Treasury and Finance Minister Robertson released a report stating that the Government's surplus had increased from NZ$2 billion to NZ$7.5 billion. The net Government debt had also fallen to 19.2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is still short of its self-imposed Budget Responsibility Rules to keep debt at less than 20% of GDP. The total government revenue also increased from NZ$6.2 billion to NZ$86.5 billion as a result of taxation. However, the total district health board deficit rose to NZ$1 billion while the net Crown debt rose by 0.2% from NZ$57.5 billion in the 2017-2018 financial year to NZ$57.7 billion in 2019.[182][183] In response, National's Economic development spokesman Todd McClay claimed that the Government was not investing enough money in taxpayers and highlighted declining business confidence.[184]

On 23 October 2019, parliament, which had debated the End of Life Choice Bill, voted 63 votes to 57 to have the issue of euthanasia decided by a referendum at the next election. New Zealand First's members had stated that they would vote against the legislation as a block if the proposal to hold a referendum was rejected.[185] On 13 November, the End of Life Choice Bill passed its third and final reading.[186][187]

In later October 2019, the Regional Development Minister Shane Jones announced that the Government would be investing NZ$20 million into re-establishing Hillside Engineering in South Dunedin as a major heavy engineering and KiwiRail servicing hub. Hillside Engineering's operations had been wound down in 2012 due to the previous National Government's decision to buy train components from China.[188][189][190]

In early November 2019, New Zealand and China agreed to upgrade their free trade agreement. China has agreed to ease restrictions on New Zealand imports, commit to environmental standards and give NZ preferential access to its wood and paper trade. In return, New Zealand has agreed to ease visa restrictions for Chinese tour guides and Chinese language teachers.[191][192]

On 6 November 2019, the Government reversed a controversial decision by Immigration New Zealand to exclude non-resident Indian arranged marriages from the partnership visa program.[193] Immigration NZ's earlier decision to tighten their partnership visa rules had drawn allegations of racism from the New Zealand Indian community.[194]

On 7 November 2019, the Government's Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill passed its third reading with the near-unanimous support of most parties excluding the ACT Party. The opposition National Party supported the bill's passages into law despite some disagreements with the Government.[195][196][197]

On 18 November, Associate Housing Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would be amending the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. Proposed changes have included limited rent increases to once every twelve months, banning rental bidding, ending "no cause" evictions, extending the notice period that landlords have to give tenants for selling rental property from 42 days to 63–90 days, and letting tenants make minor fittings, and anonymising complaints to the tenancy tribunal. Andrew King of the NZ Property Investors Federation and National Party leader Simon Bridges claimed that these changes would make it more difficult to evict "troublesome" tenants and would do little to address the housing shortage. By contrast, the Green Party and tenancy advocacy group Renters United have welcomed these changes as a win for tenants' rights.[198][199][200]

On 23 November 2019, the Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would be amending the Electoral Amendment Bill to allow prisoners who had been sentenced to less than three years in prison to vote in time for the 2020 New Zealand general election; reversing the Fifth National Government's decision to strip all prisoners of their voting rights in 2010. Little argued that restoring prisoners' voting rights would aid their reintegration into society. The Government's policy shift had been preceded by a successful legal challenge mounted by prisoners advocate Arthur William Taylor in 2013 and a Waitangi Tribunal report that the voting ban on prisoners disproportionately affected Māori prisoners. While Little's announcement was welcomed by Green MP Ghahraman, National Party leader Bridges accused the Government of being "soft on crime."[201][202][203]

On 28 November 2019, Prime Minister Ardern marked the 40th anniversary of the Erebus air disaster by apologizing on behalf of the Government and national carrier Air New Zealand to the families of the victims.[204][205][206]

In early December 2019, Justice Minister Little announced that the Government would be introducing legislation to ban foreign donations over the amount of NZ$50 in a move to combat foreign interference in New Zealand elections.

On 28 July, the Government suspended New Zealand's extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to the Chinese Government's Hong Kong national security law introduced earlier that month.

This funding boost violated the Green Party's own policy of private schools receiving state funds. Shaw had defended the decision, claiming it would have created 200 jobs and boosted the local economy. The Education Minister Chris Hipkins stated that he would not have prioritised funding for the private school and sympathised with state schools' dissatisfaction with Shaw's decision.[341][342][343] Following considerable criticism, Shaw apologised for approving the funding of the Green School, describing it as "an error of judgment" on 1 September. Representatives of the school have reportedly approach the Crown to convert part or all off the Government's grant into a loan.[344][345] On 2 November, it was reported that Michael and Rachel Perrett, the owners of the Green School, had reached a settlement for the Government's NZ$11.7 million grant to be converted into a loan; a development that was welcomed by local principals.[346][347]

On 13 February 2020, the Government agreed to pay NZ$40 million to 212 kiwifruit orchardists and Te Puke–based post harvest operator Seeka in order to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that the Government was liable for losses caused by the incursion of the kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae (PSA), which swept through the Bay of Plenty region in 2010. Kiwifruit orchardists had initially challenged a Court of Appeal ruling that the Government could not be held liable for the damage caused by PSA despite the Ministry of Primary Industries allowing PSA into the country through the import of kiwifruit pollen from China. As a result of the settlement, the appeal was withdrawn.[384][385]

On 14 February, Prime Minister Ardern announced that Auckland would move into an Alert Level 3 lockdown from 11:59pm that night for a period of three days. The rest of New Zealand will move into an Alert Level 2 lockdown for the same time period. The three-day lockdown is meant for the Government to get more information about a new community outbreak in Papatoetoe, South Auckland. Under Level 3, remote work is encouraged, while schools and day care centers continue to serve the children of essential workers. Limits have also been placed on public gatherings and travel around Auckland. Under Level 2, gatherings are restricted to 100 people and travel to Auckland is restricted.[386]

On 15 February, the Government tabled its response to the report of the Social Services and Community Committee on Matters related to Forced Adoptions.[387] At the same time, Minister of Justice Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would pursue reform of adoption laws during the 53rd Parliament.[388] The Government had already referred a review of surrogacy laws to the Law Commission,[389] the adoption inquiry is therefore to be conducted by the Ministry of Justice.[390]

On 24 February, it was reported that the Government's Progressive Home Ownership Scheme, which cost NZ$17 million, had only resettled 12 families in the last seven months. While Housing Minister Megan Woods defended the scheme's achievements, National's housing spokesperson Nicola Willis described the program as a failure.[391]

On 25 February, the Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta's Local Electoral (Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act 2021, which eliminated mechanisms for holding public referendums on the establishment of Māori wards and constituencies on local bodies, passed its third reading.

On 14 April, the New Zealand Government confirmed that a ban on live cattle exports by sea would be implemented over the two next years. The ban came as a result of a review into livestock exports launched two years ago by Agricultural Minister Damien O'Connor. The Government's ban on live cattle exports was criticised by the Animal Genetics Trade Association which complained that the ban would prevent the export of breeding cows, which would potentially lead to the culling of 150,000 calves. By contrast, the animal welfare NGO SAFE welcomed the ban, stating that it would mean that animals would no longer suffer in countries with lower standards of animal welfare than New Zealand.[398]

On 21 April, Health Minister Andrew Little announced that the existing 20 district health boards will be abolished and replaced by a new public health agency known as Health New Zealand, which will be modeled after the United Kingdom's National Health Service. In addition, a new Māori Health Authority will be established to set up policies for Māori health and to oversee the provision of Māori health services. A Public Health Authority will also be established to centralise public health work.[399][400]

On 18 May, the Health Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would seek to amend Section 23 of the Medicines Act 1981 after the High Court Judge Rebecca Ellis ruled in favour of the Ngai Kaitiaki Tuku Ihu Medical Action Society's contention that the Government's decision to approve the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine exceeded the powers of the Medicines Act. The Medical Action Society had argued that this action would have undermined public trust in the vaccine and wasted vaccine stock already in use in New Zealand.[401]

On 14 June 2021, the Government announced that it would introduce subsidies to make electric vehicles cheaper while raising the price of new petrol and new diesel vehicles, commencing in July.[402] This policy announcement followed a report by the Climate Change Commission on 9 June 2021 advocating the reduction of farm animal numbers, a ban on new household gas connections by 2025, and a shift to electric vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions.[403] In response to the policy announcement, EV City owner David Boot said that it would boost demand for electric cars while expressing concern about the need for educating electric car users. Motor Trade Association chief executive Craig Pomare claimed that the rebate would not be enough to encourage motor users to make the switch to electric cars while Federated Farmers national president Andrew Hoggard express concerns about the lack of electric vehicle alternatives for farmers and tradespersons.[404]

In mid–June 2021, Prime Minister Ardern announced that the New Zealand Government would formally apologise for the dawn raids which had disproportionately targeted members of the Pasifika communities during the 1970s and 1980s. This official apology will take place at the Auckland Town Hall on 26 June 2021.[405] The Government's apology announcement was supported by both the Minister for Pacific Peoples William Sio and National Party leader Judith Collins.[406][407]

On 7 July, the ACT party alleged that the Labour Government had spent $4 million-worth of Parliament's time asking itself questions since the 2020 election, in response to criticism of ACT's use of 15 minutes to ask its leader David Seymour questions about his member's bill, which has been described as "extremely unlikely to ever become law." Ministers being asked questions by their own party's MPs has been a feature of Question Time under successive governments for decades. The Shadow Leader of the House, National MP Chris Bishop, who has been critical of the use of "patsy questions" in the past,[408] said that Seymour was showing "remarkable hutzpah" in complaining about the practice the day after making use of it himself.[409][410]

On 16 July, the farmers advocacy group Groundswell NZ staged a nationwide protest campaign called "Howl of a Protest" in 57 towns and cities across New Zealand to protest the Government's freshwater, biodiversity, winter grazing, climate change, and Clean Car Package rebate scheme (known as the "Ute tax"). Farmers, tradespersons and agricultural sector professionals claimed that the so-called "Ute tax" discriminated Ute users due to the lack of electrical alternatives.[411][412][413] In response, the Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor stated that farmers had a right to speak their mind but warned that Groundswell's protests would create the perception that farmers were opposed to improving freshwater quality, addressing climate change, managing animal welfare, and ignored the Government's efforts to work with the sector.[414] Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ardern defended the Government's commitment to the environment and brushed off suggestions of a rural-urban divide in New Zealand.[413]

On 30 July 2021, Justice Minister Kris Faafoi introduced the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill with the goal of banning conversion therapy.[415][416] On 6 August 2021, the Bill passed its first reading with the support of all political parties except the opposition National Party, which wanted provisions protecting parents from prosecution.[417][418]

On 16 August, Prime Minister Ardern and New Zealand Defence Force chief Air Marshal Kevin Short announced that New Zealand would deploy 40 troops to evacuate 53 New Zealanders and 37 Afghans who had worked for the NZ military in response to the 2021 Taliban offensive. The Afghan evacuees include nuclear family members, numbering about 200 individuals.[419] By 23 August, the first batch of Afghan evacuees had arrived in New Zealand via the United Arab Emirates, where arrangements were made for their travel to New Zealand with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force. In addition, New Zealand provided $3 million in funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Afghanistan.[420] The Taliban's Cultural Commission representative Abdul Qahar Balkhi welcomed New Zealand's humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.[421][422]

On 17 August, the Government reinstated Alert Level 4 restrictions on New Zealand in response to a community outbreak of the Delta variant in Auckland.[423][424] In response to the spread of community cases in Auckland and Wellington, the lockdown was extended for the rest of the month on 20 August and 23 August.[425][426] On 23 August, Parliament was suspended for a week with the exception of online select committee hearings. National Party leader Judith Collins and ACT Party leader David Seymour criticised this suspension as undemocratic and an "overreach of power."[427]

Following the 2021 Taliban offensive which led to a significant exodus of Afghan refugees, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade suspended the processing of residency applications from Afghan nationals in late August 2021, citing the "rapidly deteriorating situation" caused by the Taliban offensive which complicated international evacuation efforts.[428] The Government's decision to suspend the processing of Afghan residency visa applications was criticised by human rights advocates and Afghan migrants. Former Afghan interpreter Diamond Kazimi stated that 200 Afghan families who had assisted the NZDF were still waiting for their visa applications to be processed. By 26 August, a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) C-130 Hercules had made two evacuation flights from Kabul.[429] That same day, the RNZAF suspended its evacuation flights following the 2021 Kabul airport attacks. By that stage, 370 people had been evacuated to the United Arab Emirates, where they were transferred to New Zealand.[430][431]

On 23 August, the Government temporarily suspended the sitting of the New Zealand Parliament for one week at the advice of Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield. Select committees will continue online. The suspension of Parliament was criticised by National Party leader Collins and ACT Party leader Seymour as undemocratic and an "overreach of power."[432] Labour, the Greens and the opposition Māori Party proposed a virtual Zoom Parliament and Question Time but National COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop countered that Parliament should be able to go ahead if the Prime Minister was able to hold press conferences at Level 4.[433] On 31 August, Speaker Trevor Mallard confirmed that Parliament would continue meeting under Alert Level 4 conditions with only ten MPs and a small number of staff attending the debating chamber. While Labour, National, the ACT, and Green parties agreed to send MPs, the Māori Party stated that it would not since it was unsafe.[434]

On 22 September, the Government announced a ten-year plan called Kia Manawanui for improving mental health outcomes including setting up an external oversight group headed by Auckland University of Technology (AUT) professor and Waitematā District Health Board chair Judy McGregor. In response, the National Party's mental health spokesperson Matt Doocey criticised the plan, stating that " what is needed now is action, not more vision statements, working groups and nice words."[435] In mid-September, the Government also announced the members of the interim boards of Health New Zealand and the Māori Health Authority. Health NZ will be chaired by Rob Campbell while the Health Authority will be led by co-chairs Sharon Shea and Tipa Mahuta.[436][437]

On 30 September, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Act 2021 passed its third reading, introducing new counter-terrorism laws which criminalise the planning of terror attacks and expand the powers of police to conduct warrantless searches. The counter-terrorism bill was supported by the Labour and National parties but was opposed by the Green, ACT and Māori parties.[438] That same day, the Government introduced the Te Kāhui o Matariki Public Holiday Bill to make the Māori New Year Matariki a public holiday. During its first reading, the bill was supported by the Labour, Green and Māori parties but opposed by National and ACT.[439]

On 30 September, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would introduce a one-off simplified residency pathway known as the "2021 resident visa" for migrants on work visas residing in New Zealand including their families. Faafoi estimated that 165,000 migrants would be eligible for the 2021 resident visa programme, which will be rolled out in two phases in December 2021 and March 2022. According to Faafoi, the scheme was meant to address the impact of closed borders and economic hardship caused by COVID-19 on migrants. The announcement was welcomed by the National Party's immigration spokesperson Erica Stanford and Migrant Workers Association President Anu Kaloti for addressing the needs and concerns of migrants.[440][441]

On 7 October, Foreign Minister Mahuta confirmed that the Government was sending a special representative to the Middle East to help 825 stranded Afghan visa holders to leave Afghanistan. During the 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan, the Government had granted 1,253 visas to Afghans. However, only 428 had arrived in New Zealand following the Taliban takeover.[442]

On 19 October, the Labour and National parties supported a bipartisan housing bill called the Resource Management (Enabling Housing Supply and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, which aims to build 105,500 new homes over the next eight years. Under the proposed bill, three homes of up to three storeys can be built on most sites without the need for going through the resource consent process. The Government plans to pass the bill by the end of 2021, with local councils to implement it from August 2022.[443][444] The Bill passed its second reading on 7 December.[445]

On 21 October, the New Zealand and United Kingdom Governments signed a free trade agreement eliminating tariffs on 97% of New Zealand exports to the UK. This free trade agreement is worth NZ$970 million and will eliminate tariffs on all New Zealand exports including honey, wine, kiwifruit, onions, most industrial products. In addition, a range of dairy and beef exports will be tariff free after a period of 15 years.[446][447]

On 27 October, Local Government Minister Nanaia Mahuta confirmed that the Government would proceed with its "Three Waters reform programme" to take control of the management of storm water, drinking water and wastewater from local councils and territorial bodies. The "Three Waters" reforms would place these water services and assets under the control of four new water entities in order to improve the quality of water utilities and lower the cost of water services. The Government planned to start creating these four new entities in late 2021, which will assume control of water utilities in July 2024.[448][449] The Government's decision to centralize water utilities and services was criticised by several local councils and mayors including Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff, Mayor of Christchurch Lianne Dalziel, Mayor of Hastings Sandra Hazlehurst, Mayor of the Far North District John Carter, Mayor of Dunedin Aaron Hawkins, and Mayor of Wellington Andy Foster.[450][451][452] In addition, the opposition National and ACT parties have vowed to repeal the Three Waters reforms if elected into government.[453] By contrast, Ngāi Tahu's Dr Te Maire Tau, the co-chair of Te Kura Taka Pini (the iwi's freshwater group) welcomed the Three Water reforms, claiming they would improve water services and environmental outcomes.[454]

On 29 October, Ministry for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni and Justice Minister Little announced that the Government would establish a new Ministry for Disabled People within the Ministry of Social Development to reform the disability support system and improve outcomes for disabled peoples.

Disabled Person Assembly chief executive Prudence Walker welcomed the Government's efforts to prioritise the needs of disabled people but express concerns about funding, disabled leadership, and the limitations of the Accessibility Governance Board.[456]

On 11 November, Justice Minister Kris Faafoi introduced the Three Strikes Legislation Repeal Bill to repeal the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010. While the proposed repeal legislation was supported by the Labour and Green parties, the opposition National and ACT parties defended the "three strikes law." National's justice spokesperson Simon Bridges and ACT's justice spokeswoman Nicole McKee claimed that repealing the "three strikes law" would encourage gangs and violent crime offenders.[457][458]

On 24 November, Hipkins announced that Indonesia, Fiji, India, Pakistan, and Brazil would be removed from the "Very High-Risk" classification in early December 2021; allowing travellers from these countries to enter New Zealand on the same basis as other international travellers.

Third, all fully vaccinated travellers would be exempt from MIQ from 30 April.[459][460]

On 24 November, the Government's COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 passed its third reading, allowing businesses to dismiss employees who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

On 9 December, Associate Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall confirmed that the Government would introduce new legislation under the Smokefree 2025 goal that would ban anyone under the age of 14 from legally purchasing tobacco for the rest of their lives. Older generations will only be permitted to buy tobacco products with very low-levels of nicotine while fewer shops will be allowed to sell tobacco products. The Government's announcement was welcomed by the Green Party and several health leaders including New Zealand Medical Association chair Dr Alistair Humphrey, Health Coalition Aotearoa smokefree expert advisory group chair Sally Liggins, and University of Auckland Associate Dean of Pacific Collin Tukuitonga for addressing the health effects of smoking particularly within the Māori and Pasifika communities. By contrast, ACT health spokesperson Karen Chhour criticised the proposed legislation, stating that prohibition was unworkable and claiming that it would create a black market for tobacco products.[465][466]

On 15 December, the Resource Management (Enabling Housing Supply and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2021 passed its third and final reading with the bipartisan support of most parties except ACT.

On 26 January, the Government asked suppliers Abbott Laboratories, Roche, and Siemens to give the Government priority in ordering stocks of rapid antigen tests. The Government was criticised by several private companies and representative bodies including the Health Works Group, the Food and Grocery Council, and InScience for allegedly commandeering their orders. In response to criticism, Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield denied that the Government was requisitioning their orders but was merely asking suppliers to consolidate forward orders of rapid antigen tests. The opposition National and ACT parties accused the Government of requisitioning rapid antigen tests from the private sector to hide its alleged incompetence in obtaining rapid antigent tests.[473][474][475]

In late January 2022, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced that the New Zealand Government had approved a NZ$14.6 billion project to establish a partially tunneled light rail network between Auckland Airport and the Auckland CBD. The planned light rail network will integrate with current train and bus hubs as well as the City Rail Link's stations and connections. Transport Minister Michael Wood also added that the Government would decide on plans to establish a second harbour crossing at Waitemata Harbour in 2023. The light rail network was supported by the Green Party but criticised by the ACT party as a waste of taxpayer revenue.[476][477]

On 15 February 2022, the Government's Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Act 2022 passed its third and final reading, becoming law with broad cross-party support.[478] The bill's passage was aided by the new National Party leader Christopher Luxon's decision to abandon the Party's bloc vote opposition to the legislation and allow caucus members a conscientious vote.[479][480]

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ardern and Mahuta issued a statement on 24 February condemning Russia's invasion and calling on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. In addition, New Zealand suspended high-level diplomatic contacts with Russia and introduced travel bans and export controls.[481]

On 1 March, New Zealand and the United Kingdom formally ratified a bilateral free trade agreement announced in October 2021. This agreement eliminates all tariffs on New Zealand exports particularly meat, butter and cheese along with duties on 99.5% of current trade. Ardern described the free trade agreement as a "gold-standard free trade agreement" that would help accelerate the country's economic recovery.[482]

On 7 March, Ardern announced that the Government would be introducing a new Russia Sanctions Act 2022 under urgency to enable autonomous sanctions against in response to its recent invasion of Ukraine. This legislation would allow sanctions to be placed on those responsible for or associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine including people, services, companies and assets. Key provisions include freezing assets based in New Zealand; preventing people and companies from moving their money and assets to NZ in order to escape foreign sanctions; banning super yachts, ships and aircraft from entering New Zealand waters and airspace, and imposing a travel ban on 100 top Russian officials.

On 10 March, Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi announced plans to merge the two public broadcasters Radio New Zealand (RNZ) and Television New Zealand (TVNZ) into a new public broadcasting service. The new broadcasting entity would have complete editorial independence, operate under a charter, and be funded through a mixture of government funding and commercial revenue. It is expected to launch in July 2023. While the proposed merger was welcomed by RNZ chief executive Paul Thompson and TVNZ chief executive Simon Power, the opposition National Party described it as wasteful and unnecessary.[487][488]

On 14 March, Ardern announced that the Government would reduce fuel excise taxes and road user charges by 25 cents a litre for the next three months from 11:59 pm that night. In addition, all public transport fares would be halved from 1 April 2022 for the next three months. This announcement was in response to a global energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[489] Ardern had initially denied that New Zealand was experiencing a "cost of living crisis" but had since reconsidered her position. Over the past 12 months, the rising cost of living had led New Zealanders to spend an extra NZ$4000 to $5000 on basic commodities such as food, rent and fuel. Customers spent an extra NZ$678 a year on petrol on average.[490]

On 15 March, Ardern announced that the Government would introduce a new two-year work visa programme allowing New Zealand citizens and residents of Ukrainian descent to sponsor Ukrainian family members seeking to shelter in New Zealand. This "Special Ukraine Policy" aims to bring over 4,000 Ukrainians and comes with work and study rights. In addition, the Government contributed another NZ$4 billion in humanitarian aid.[491][492]

On 17 March, the Government launched its "Te Takanga o Te Wā" history curriculum, which emphasizes the teaching of New Zealand history including the contributions of the Māori, Pasifika and Asian communities.

On 24 March, Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi and Australian Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews jointly announced that the two governments had reached an agreement for New Zealand to accept 150 refugees a year as part of its annual refugee quota from the Nauru Regional Processing Centre or asylum seekers temporarily in Australia for "processing." Refugees being resettled in New Zealand will have to go through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) process and meet the criteria for NZ's refugee quota requirements. As part of the deal, 450 refugees would be resettled in New Zealand over a three-year period. The Morrison Government had decided to accept a 2012 deal between former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard for New Zealand to accept several asylum seekers who had travelled to Australia by sea. Subsequent Australian governments had declined to accept New Zealand's offer due to concerns that it would encourage more asylum seekers to travel by boat to Australia and that former asylum seekers could gain New Zealand citizenship and migrate to Australia.[495][496]

On 25 March 2022, Ardern and Mahuta joined the Australian Government in expressing concerns about a proposed Solomon Islands security agreement with China, which would allow China to deploy military and security forces in the Solomon Islands and establish a military base there.[497][498][499]

On 8 May, Ardern announced that the Government would allocating NZ$23 million from the State Sector Decarbonisation Fund to reduce greenhouse emissions. As part of the investment, NZ$10 million would be spent on replacing coal boilers at 180 New Zealand schools with clean wood burners or electrical heating. In addition, NZ$12.92 million would be spent on other projects including purchasing electrical vehicles, charging infrastructure, and upgrading heating systems at various public facilities including hospitals, police stations, the University of Waikato and Northland Polytechnic.[500]

On 9 May, Police Minister Poto Williams, Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis, and Justice Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would be investing NZ$562 million to combat crime over the next four years.

On 11 May, Ardern announced that New Zealand's border reopening would be accelerated. From 16 May, the border would reopen to Pacific Island visitors. From 4 July, the border would reopen to all work visa holders and a new "green list" would be introduced in order to attract "high-skilled" migrants for "hard to fill positions." In addition, the border would reopen to all visitor and student visa holders as well as cruise ships on 31 July. In addition, streamlined residency pathways would be introduced in September 2022 for migrants in "green list" occupations or who earn twice the median wage.[502][503] However, new working restrictions would be introduced to international students including limiting working rights to degree-level students with the exception of certain specified occupations, limiting undergraduate working rights to the length of their courses, and preventing students from applying for a second post-study work visa.[504] The Government's decision to exclude nurses, teachers, and dairy farm managers from the visa residency "green list" was also criticised by professional bodies.[505] In early August 2022, the Government acknowledged that it had not consulted professional nursing organisations and the district health boards about its nursing "green list" visa scheme.[506] On 8 August, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment admitted that only nine nurses had applied for the "green list" scheme by late July 2022.[507]

In late May 2022, Ardern led a trade and tourism mission to the United States. During her trip, she urged the Biden Administration to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and promoted New Zealand's firearms legislation in response to the Robb Elementary School shooting.[508][509] On 28 May, Ardern signed a memorandum of understanding with Governor of California Gavin Newsom facilitating bilateral cooperation between New Zealand and California in climate change emissions mitigation and research.[510]

On 2 June, Mahuta introduced the Water Services Entities Bill as the first of several new bills to entrench the Three Waters reform programme into law. The proposed bill would establish the four regional water services entities which would take over management of water infrastructure from the 67 local councils. While councils would retain ownership of their water assets through a "community share" arrangement, the new water service entities would exercise effective control over the water assets. Mahuta also confirmed that further legislation would be introduced to facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities from local authorities to the Water Services Entities, integrate entities into other regulatory systems, and to ensure economic regulation and consumer protection over the new entities.[511][512][513] The opposition National and ACT parties claimed that the proposed bill amounted to the theft of local water assets, bureaucratic centralisation, and would inflame ethnic divisions.[512] Communities 4 Local Democracy leader and Manawatū District Mayor Helen Worboys opposed the bill on the grounds that it would take local community assets without compensation.[513]

On 7 June, the Government's Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 passed its third reading. The bill replaces the country's existing district health boards with a new Crown agency called Health New Zealand and establishes as separate Māori Health Authority. The Health Futures Act also establishes a new Public Health Agency within the Ministry of Health while strengthening the Ministry's stewardship role. It also includes a rural health strategy. While Labour and the Māori Party supported the bill as a means of facilitating health reforms and ensuring Māori co-governance, the opposition National Party questioned the government's proposed reforms while the ACT Party expressed concerns about racial division.[514]

On 13 June, a cabinet reshuffle occurred. Kris Faafoi resigned from Parliament, with his immigration, justice, and broadcasting portfolios being assumed by Michael Wood, Kiri Allan, and Willie Jackson. In addition, Ardern confirmed that Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard would be resigning in mid-August 2022 to assume a diplomatic post in Europe. Adrian Rurawhe was designated as his successor. In addition, Poto Williams stepped down from her Police ministerial portfolio, which was assumed by Chris Hipkins. Priyanca Radhakrishnan was promoted to Cabinet while retaining her community and voluntary sector, ethnic communities, youth, associate social development portfolios and adopting the associate workplace relations portfolios. Former Chief Whip Kieran McAnulty became deputy leader of the House while gaining the associate transport, associate local government, emergency management and racing portfolios. In addition, Dr Ayesha Verrall assumed the COVID-19 response and Research, Science and Innovation ministerial portfolios; Duncan Webb became the new Chief Whip; and Meka Whatiri assumed the food safety portfolio.[515][516][517] Labour list MPs Dan Rosewarne and Soraya Peke-Mason replaced the outgoing Faafoi and Mallard.[517]

In mid-June 2022, Broadcasting Minister Willie Jackson introduced draft legislation to formally merge public broadcasters Radio New Zealand and TVNZ into a new non-profit autonomous Crown entity called Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media (ANZPM). The new broadcasting service is expected to come into existence on 1 March 2023. Under the proposed Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media Bill, RNZ and TVNZ would become subsidiaries of the new entity, headed by a single board. ANZPM would be funded through a mixture of commercial and government funding. The new organisation would also operate under a charter outlining goals and responsibilities, with editorial independence being enshrined in its statutory legislation. The Government has also allocated NZ$370m over four years in operating expenditure and $306m in capital funding from the 2022 New Zealand budget for funding the ANZPM.[518][519]

On 27 June, Ardern confirmed that New Zealand would contribute NZ$4.5 million worth of aid to the NATO Trust Fund including medical kits, fuel, communications equipment, and rations for the Ukrainian Army, bringing the total amount of New Zealand military assistance to Ukraine to $33 million. In addition, the Government dispatched a military officer to support the International Criminal Court's investigation into alleged Russian war crimes. New Zealand also contributed $1 million to the ICC Trust Fund for Victims and the ICC Office of the Prosecutor. In addition, the Government extended the deployment and number of New Zealand military and intelligence personnel assisting NATO forces in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany.[520]

On 30 June, Mahuta and Parker confirmed that New Zealand would support Ukraine's legal challenge at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) contesting Russia's claim that it had invaded Ukraine in response to alleged Ukrainian genocide in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. This marked the second time that New Zealand had filed a legal challenge at the ICJ in support of another country. In 2012, New Zealand had supported Australia's case against Japanese whaling at the ICJ.[521]

On 11 July, Economic and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash announced that the Government had loaned NZ$6 million from the Regional Strategic Partnership Fund to help food producer New Zealand Functional Foods build an oat milk factory in Makarewa, Southland. The factory will cost NZ$50 million and is due to be completed in 2023. The oat milk factory is estimated to produce 80 million litres of oat milk and create 50 new jobs. While New Zealand produces oats, the country lacked an oat milk processing facility and was forced to import the product from Australia.[522][523]

On 13 July, Police Minister Hipkins and Justice Minister Kiri Allan announced that the Government would introduce several new laws to combat criminal gangs including a new criminal offence for firing a gun with intention to intimidate; expanding the range of offences for Police to seize vehicles and financial assets; empowering Police and law enforcement agencies to seize cash over NZ$10,000 found in suspicious circumstances; and expanding Police search and warrant powers to find and confiscate weapons from gang members. Hipkins confirmed that these new offenses would be packaged in a new omnibus amendment bill. In response, the National Party's acting police spokesperson Chris Penk claimed that the Government's measures were insufficient in tackling organised crime and called on the Government to ban gang patches and giving Police the powers to disrupt gangs' communications, ability to organise their activities, and warrantless search powers.[524]

On 19 July, the Government extended the 25-cent fuel tax cut and the half price public transportation subsidy until late January 2023 in a bid to combat rising inflation in New Zealand.[525]

On 27 July, the Government's Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products (Smoked Tobacco) Amendment Bill passed its first reading. The bill proposes reducing the number of retailers allowed to sell tobacco, reducing the amount of nicotine allowed in tobacco products, and banning the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009.[526] The bill was supported by most parties with the exception of the libertarian ACT Party. While the National and Green parties supported the legislation, the former voiced concern about the experimental nature of the bill while the latter raised concerns about criminal prohibition pushing the tobacco industry "underground."[527]

On 1 August, the Government launched its "cost of living payment" support programme as part of the 2022 New Zealand Budget. People eligible for these payments include New Zealand tax residents 18 years and above who are earning below NZ$70,000 a year, and who are not entitled to the Winter Energy Payment and are not in prison. Two million people are considered to be eligible for the cost of living payments. The first NZ$116 payment was released on 1 August with the second and third payments following on 1 September and 1 October 2022.[528][529] The rollout was plagued by reports that overseas-based New Zealanders were receiving payments since the Inland Revenue Department had opted to dispense the payments automatically rather than manually check the eligibility of tax residents. The opposition National Party accused the Government of wasting taxpayer money.[530]

On 1 August, Health Minister Little announced that the Government would be spending NZ$14.4 million to recruit more health workers including doctors, nurses, and radiographers for the country's health workforce. As part of the package, the Government would be providing overseas nurses NZ$10,000 to help cover registration costs. In addition, the Government announced that it would be launching a six-month bridging programme for overseas-trained doctors. Other measures include encouraging retired nurses to return to work, expanding a pilot programme allowing overseas-trained doctors to intern at general practitioners' clinics rather than hospitals, and boosting the number of nurse practitioners and doctors. The Government also confirmed that it would launch a national and international healthcare recruitment campaign in coordination with the TVNZ soap opera series Shortland Street. The new international recruitment service would be housed within the new public health agency Health New Zealand.[531][532]

On 9 August, the Government's Three Strikes Legislation Repeal Bill passed its third and final reading, repealing the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010. The bill was supported by the Labour, Green, and Māori parties but was opposed by the National and ACT parties. While Justice Minister Kiri Allan and Green MP Elizabeth Kerekere welcomed the repeal of what they described as a punitive law that did little to rehabilitate or reintegrate criminals, the National and ACT parties' justice spokespersons Paul Goldsmith and Nicole McKee claimed the Government was ignoring the crime rate and vowed to reinstate the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act if re-elected in the future.[533][534]

On 22 August 2022, the New Zealand Government purchased Kiwibank's holdings company Kiwi Group Holdings for an estimated NZ$2.1 billion. As a result, the Government acquired full control of the state-owned bank from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, ACC, and New Zealand Post.[535]

On 30 August, Revenue Minister David Parker announced that it would introduce legislation to apply the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to KiwiSaver fees. The Inland Revenue Department estimated that this proposed tax change could generate NZ$226 million in tax revenue from 2026.[536] Following intense public criticism from fund managers and the opposition National Party, the Government abandoned its plans to apply GST taxation on Kiwisaver fees.[537][538]

Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Ardern announced that a one-off public holiday would be held on 26 September to mark the monarch's passing. The holiday would coincide with a state memorial service for Elizabeth at the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul. This holiday is similar to other public holidays held in the United Kingdom on 19 September and Australia on 22 September to mark the Queen's passing. While the Greens and opposition National Party supported the Government's plans for the one-off holiday, the ACT Party and businesses expressed concerns about the adverse economic impact on businesses.[539] On 20 September, Parliament passed urgent legislation creating a once-off public holiday on 26 September. While Labour, National and the Green parties supported the bill, it was opposed by the ACT and Māori parties.[540][541]

On 12 September, Ardern announced that the country's COVID-19 Protection Framework ("traffic light system") would end at 11:59pm that night. As a result, face masks will be eliminated for most public spaces and transportation with the exception of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and aged care facilities. In addition, household contacts of COVID-19 positive individuals will not be required to isolate unless they test positive for COVID-19. In addition, vaccine mandates for all travellers entering New Zealand and healthcare workers will end on 13 September and 27 September respectively. COVID-19 antiviral medicines will also be freely provided to COVID-19 positive individuals aged 65 years and above as well as Māori and Pasifika COVID-19 positive individuals aged 50 years and above.[542][543]

On 28 September, the Government passed the Animal Welfare Amendment Act 2022 which would ban live animal exports from April 2023. The bill was supported by the Labour and Green parties but was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties. The Government's ban on live animal exports was motivated by the Gulf Livestock 1 disaster in September 2020.[544][545]

On 11 October, Prime Minister Ardern announced plans to tax the emissions produced by farm animals by 2025. Agricultural emissions by farm animals including burping and urination account for about half of New Zealand's emissions. The Government's proposal was criticised by Federated Farmers national president Andrew Hoggard, who said it would hurt the farming sector by discouraging farmers from making a living. Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand's lead climate campaigner Christine Rose claimed the Government's proposed tax on agricultural emissions was insufficient and favoured dairy producers over beef and sheep farmers and Māori landowners.[546][547]

On 21 October, Transport Minister Michael Wood announced that the Government would launch a NZ$1.3 billion national payment system for all bus, train and ferry fares called the National Ticketing Solution. Waka Kotahi (the New Zealand Transport Agency) and several urban and regional councils had signed contracts with the public transport company Cubic Corporation. The national payment system would be gradually rolled out across the country and would replace existing municipal and regional payment systems including the Bee Card.[548][549]

On 27 October, the Government's Fair Pay Agreements Act 2022 passed its third reading in Parliament. The bill allows employers and employees to collectively bargain at an industry-wide level. While the bill was supported by the Labour, Green and Māori parties, it was opposed by the National and ACT parties which vowed to repeal it if elected into government at the next general election.[550][551]

On 4 November 2022, the Government introduced the Arms Act Amendment Bill to stop gun licenses from expiring until Police were able to resolve a backlog of renewing firearms licenses. At the time, there were 12,000 people on the waitlist for a new firearms license. Of this figure, half had been on the waitlist for six months or longer, 1569 had been waiting for at least a year, and 72 have been waiting for two years or more.[552]

In mid November 2022, the Government introduced two new bills, the Natural and Built Environment Bill (NBA) and the Spatial Planning Bill (SPA), as part of its efforts to replace the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). The NBA replaces the Government's environmental policy statements with a National Planning Framework (NPF). Under the NPF framework, all 15 regions will be required to develop a Natural and Built Environment Plan (NBE) that will replace the 100 district and regional plans, harmonising consenting and planning rules. An independent national Māori entity will also be established to provide input into the NPF and ensure compliance with the Treaty of Waitangi's provisions. The SSPA will deal with long-term planning. Local committees will be required to develop 30-year regional spatial strategies (RSS) for regional NBEs.[553][554] In response, the opposition National and ACT parties criticised the Government's proposed overhaul of the RMA legislation on the grounds that it created more centralisation, bureaucracy, and did little to reform the problems associated with the RMA process. The Green Party expressed concerns about what it perceived as the lack of environment protection in the two bills.[555][556]

On 25 November, the Government and the Māori iwi/tribe Ngāti Mutunga o Wharekauri concluded an "agreement in principle" to settle historical Treaty of Waitangi claims relating to the annexation of the Chatham Islands in 1842. The agreements includes a financial redress of NZ$13 million, the option to transfer culturally significant lands to the iwi as "cultural redress," and shared redress between the iwi and Moriori.[557][558]

In response to the 2022 Sandringham dairy stabbing, Ardern and Hipkins announced that the Government would be launching a new retail crime package to combat retail crime including a fog cannon subsidy scheme, a NZ$4 million fund to support local councils' crime prevention programmes, and expanding the existing Retail Crime Prevention Fund eligibility to include aggravated robberies.[559][560]

On 5 December, Ardern and Verrall formally announced that the Government would be holding a Royal Commission of Inquiry into its COVID-19 pandemic response. The inquiry will be chaired by Australian-based epidemiologist Tony Blakely, former National Party cabinet minister Hekia Parata, and former Treasury secretary John Whitehead. The inquiry is expected to be launched on 1 February 2023 and finish in mid-2024. It will examine the overall pandemic response including the health response, border management, community care, isolation, quarantine, and the economic response including monetary policy. However, it will not examine decisions made by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Monetary Policy Committee as well as how government policies applied to individual cases.[561][562] While epidemiologist Michael Baker welcomed the inquiry as a means of preparing for future pandemics, the Green and National parties regarded the inquiry's scope as too narrow and called for a separate review into its economic impact.[563]

On 7 December 2022, the Government's Water Services Entities Act 2022 passed its third and final reading with the sole support of the Labour Party.[564] While National and ACT opposed the Bill on the grounds it promoted co-governance and centralisation, the Greens and Māori parties rejected the Bill due to its lack of anti-privatisation safeguards and alleged "insufficient" co-governance arrangements.[565][566]

On 12 December 2022, Ardern and Immigration Minister Michael Wood confirmed that the Government would add nurses and midwives to its immigration green list, making them eligible for immediate residency in New Zealand. In addition, the Government established a temporary residence immigration pathway for bus and truck drivers. Teachers and tradespeople including drain layers and motor mechanics were also added to the work to residence immigration pathway. These changes came in response to a national labour shortage across different sectors in the New Zealand economy caused by emigration and low wages. The Government also confirmed plans to add ten jobs to the green list in March 2023 including gas fitters, drain layers, crane operators, civil machine operators, telecommunication technicians, civil construction supervisors, and halal slaughterers.[567]

On 13 December, the Government's Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products (Smoked Tobacco) Amendment Act 2022 passed its third reading by a margin of 76 to 43 votes. While Labour, the Green, and Māori parties voted in favour of the Bill, it was opposed by the National and ACT parties. Associate-Health Minister Dr. Verrall argued that the legislation would help reduce tobacco harm among young people and the Māori community while National health spokesperson Dr. Reti and ACT Deputy leader Van Velden questioned the effectiveness of the legislation and argued it would cause more harm and crime in the community.[568]

2023
On 13 January, the Emergency Management Minister Kieran McAnulty and Rural Communities Minister Damien O'Connor confirmed that the Government had contributed relief assistance to farmers and communities in the Gisborne District/Tairāwhiti affected by flood damage caused by Cyclone Hale. The Government contributed NZ$150,000 to the Mayoral Relief Fund to help communities in the Gisborne District and another NZ$100,000 to help local farmers and horticulturalists affected by Cyclone Hale.[569][570][571]

On 19 January, Ardern confirmed that she would be resigning as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party prior to the 2023 New Zealand general election, scheduled for 14 October 2023. She also confirmed that she would be stepping down as MP for the Mount Albert electorate.[5][572][573] Following Ardern's resignation, Chris Hipkins was elected unopposed as the leader of the Labour Party on 21 January.[574][575] On 22 January, Carmel Sepuloni succeeded Grant Robertson as Deputy Prime Minister.[576] On 25 January, Hipkins and Sepuloni were formally sworn in as Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister respectively.[6]

After assuming office, Hipkins announced that the Labour Government would focus on "cost of living" issues such as rising rent, food prices, and building as the "heart of its work program." Hipkins also stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had created an economic crisis, which his Government would focus on.[577] In late January, Hipkins attended a roundtable event organised by the Auckland Business Chamber where he met with Auckland business leaders to discuss issues affecting the business sector including skills shortages, immigration visa settings, wage rises, and dissatisfaction with the Government's Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media merger, Three Waters reform programme, and the social unemployment insurance scheme.[578]

Following the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods which devastated Auckland, Hipkins along with Emergency Management Minister McAnulty and Transport Minister Michael Wood visited Auckland to assess the damage, liaise with local authorities and emergency services, reassure affected constituents, and attended a press conference with Mayor of Auckland Wayne Brown.[579][580] The Government also pledged NZ$100,000 to aid flood relief efforts in Auckland. On 31 January, the Government committed a further NZ$1 million to the Mayoral Relief Fund to assist affected communities in Auckland.[581]

A cabinet reshuffle occurred on 31 January. Andrew Little was replaced as Health Minister by Ayesha Verrall while Michael Wood was assigned the new Minister of Auckland portfolio in response to the 2023 North Island floods. Kieran McAnulty succeeded Nanaia Mahuta as Minister of Local Government. Mahuta herself retained her Foreign Minister portfolio. Jan Tinetti was also appointed as Education Minister and gained the child poverty reduction. Following a cabinet reshuffle that occurred on 31 January 2023, Mahuta lost her Local Government portfolio but retained her foreign affairs portfolio. Ginny Andersen and Barbara Edmonds also joined Hipkins' Cabinet. Andersen assumed the "Digital Economy and Communications, Small Business, and Seniors ministerial portfolios as well as the immigration and Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations associate portfolios. Edmonds assumed the Internal Affairs and Pacific Peoples ministerial portfolio as well as health and housing associate portfolios.[581][582]

On 1 February, Hipkins announced that the Government would spend $718 million in various "cost of living" support measures including extending the 25 cents per litre fuel excise subsidy until 30 June and half-price public transport fares until June 2023. In addition, discounted fares for 1 million Community Service Card holders and tertiary students would be made permanent from 1 July 2023. These subsidies were intended to address the high national cost of living and the effects of the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods.[583]

On 7 February, Hipkins undertook his first overseas state visit to Canberra where he met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While the two leaders reaffirmed Australian-New Zealand bilateral relations, they also discussed the controversial Section 501 deportation policy. During the visit, Albanese reiterated that his government would revise the deportation policy to take into account individuals' connections to Australia and the length of time they had lived in the country.[584][585] In response to the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, Foreign Minister Mahuta announced that New Zealand would be contributing NZ$1.5 million to assisting the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC) responses in Turkey and Syria. Hipkins also confirmed that New Zealand would be providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by the earthquake.[586]

On 8 February, Hipkins announced that several policies including the proposed TVNZ–Radio New Zealand merger and that a biofuel mandate requiring petrol and diesel to source a certain percentage of biofuel from renewable resources would be scrapped. In addition, Hipkins confirmed that other policies including the social income insurance scheme, proposed hate speech legislation, and the controversial Three Waters reform programme would be delayed or revised. Hipkins also confirmed that the minimum wage would be raised from NZ$21.20 to NZ$22.70 an hour from 1 April 2023. In response to the recent North Island floods, Hipkins conformed that the Government would invest NZ$3 million in discretionary flood recovery payments, NZ$1 million in supporting flood-affected businesses, and NZ$1 million in mental health support.[587][588][589]

On 13 February, Hipkins announced a NZ$11.5m aid package in response to storm damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. The following day, the Minister of Emergency Management McAnulty declared a national state of emergency over the Northland, Auckland, Tairawhiti, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Hawke's Bay regions; the third time a state of emergency had been declared over the country. This state of emergency allows for a national coordination of the clean-up response, provide additional resources to affected individuals, and empowers the Government to respond to dangerous situations including restricting travel.[590][591]

On 23 February, the Government ordered a ministerial inquiry into forestry companies' slash practices particularly the stockpiling of discarded branches and "offcuts," which had exacerbated flood damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. The inquiry will be led by former National Party cabinet minister Hekia Parata, former Hawke's Bay Regional Council chief executive Bill Bayfield, and forestry engineer Matthew McCloy. Several political and civil society leaders including National Party leader Luxon, the Forest Owners Association President Don Carson, Green Party co-leader Shaw and fellow Green MP Eugenie Sage, and Forestry Minister Stuart Nash supported calls for an inquiry into the forestry industry's practices and accountability from forestry companies.[592][593]

On 13 March, Hipkins announced that the Government would be scrapping several policies and reform programmes including legislation to lower the voting age to 16 years, the speed reduction programme except for the most dangerous 1% of highways, and the NZ$586 million Clean Car Upgrade programme. In addition, the Government announced that it would delay or scale-back several policies and programmes including proposed alcohol reforms, the container return scheme, public transportation including the Auckland Light Rail, and public consultation on a new test to determine the difference between contractors and employees. The Government would redirect funding to a NZ$2 billion to a welfare package to provide "bread and butter" support to 1.4 million New Zealanders affected by the ongoing "cost of living" crisis.[594][595] In response, Green Party co-leader and Climate Change Minister James Shaw expressed disappointment with cutbacks of climate action policies such as the Clear Car Upgrade during the so-called "policy bonfire." Meanwhile, Māori Party leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer expressed concerned with the Government's abandonment of several climate change policies and urged Shaw to resign as Climate Change Minister. The opposition National Party leader Christopher Luxon and deputy leader Nicola Willis welcomed the Government's decision to scrap so-called "wasteful" and "unpopular" policies but urged the Government to reduce spending and taxation. ACT Party leader David Seymour argued that New Zealanders needed a change in government and stated "that Hipkins U-turning on a tiny handful of policies isn't fooling anyone."[596][597]

In mid March 2023, the Government signed a cooperation agreement with Amazon Web Services to build large data centres in New Zealand. These data service centres will provide cloud storage services for government departments, local councils, schools, tertiary education providers, and other public service bodies. New Zealand currently does not have cloud storage facilities, with Australia providing the infrastructure and services.[598]

On 13 April 2023, the Government announced a major overhaul of its Three Waters reform programme, renaming it the Water Services Reform Programme. The proposed four water services entities were expanded into ten entities but will retain the same split co-governance structure consisting of representatives of local councils and mana whenua representatives.[599][600]

On 17 April, Hipkins and Education Minister Jan Tinetti announced plans to reduce class sizes for Years 4 to 8 pupils from 29 to 28 by the start of 2025. The Government also confirmed plans to increase the number of teachers by 320.[601] This policy received mixed responses from several principals including Lakeview School principal Tim Nelson, Rangikura School principal Eddie Uluilelata, Konini School deputy principal Khali Olivera, Te Kōmanawa Rowley School principal Graeme Norman, and Alwyn Poole of Innovative Education Consultants, who described it as insufficient and advocated smaller class sizes.[602]

Controversies
2018 Labour Party youth camp sexual assaults
On 12 March 2018, allegations of multiple sexual assaults at the Young Labour Summer School at Waitawheta Camp in Waihi emerged. It was alleged that a 20-year-old man put his hands down the pants of four sixteen-year-olds on the second night of the camp, which occurred a month earlier. It was reported that there were "mountains of alcohol" present at the camp, and that people under the legal drinking age of eighteen were consuming alcohol. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was not informed of the allegations by party leadership, despite them knowing a month earlier. Support had not been offered to the victims, something Ardern said she was "deeply sorry" for.[675][676] Ardern did not fire any of her party staffers who failed to act on information of the allegations and inform her. Former Prime Minister of the Fifth Labour Government Helen Clark criticised this response, saying "heads would have rolled" if she was at the helm.[677]

In late November 2019, the man, who had pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent assault, was discharged without conviction.[678][679] In response, one of the male victims expressed disappointment with the court decision, stating that they had lost faith in the justice system.[680][681]

Ministerial resignations
On 24 May 2018, Transport Minister Phil Twyford resigned from his Civil Aviation portfolio after making an unauthorised phone call on a domestic flight as the plane was taking off, a violation of civil aviation laws. The matter had been raised by Opposition Transport spokesperson Judith Collins.[682]

On 24 August, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the removal of Clare Curran from Cabinet, and stripped her of her Open Government and Government Digital Services porfolios. These were reassigned to Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods respectively. Curran's sacking was the result of her failure to disclose that she had held informal meetings with entrepreneur Derek Handley in November 2017 and February 2018, which could have created potential conflicts of interest.[683][684][685] After a poor performance while answering a question from National's spokesperson for Broadcasting Melissa Lee during Question Time, Curran announced that she was stepping down as Minister for Broadcasting. She was to remain as MP for Dunedin-South, and Kris Faafoi resumed her Broadcasting portfolio.[686][687]

On 30 August 2018, Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri "stood aside" from her ministerial portfolios as part of an investigation into an allegation that she assaulted a staff member in her ministerial office. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Ministerial Services was investigating the allegations. Fellow Labour MP Kris Faafoi assumed the role of Acting Minister of Customs while her associate ministerial portfolios were assumed by their lead ministers.[688][689][690] On 20 September 2018, Ardern announced that she had fired Whaitiri from all of her ministerial portfolios. Ardern said that while aspects of the incident were disputed by Whaitiri, an incident involving Whaitiri manhandling and bullying a new staff member "undoubtedly took place". Kris Faafoi took over her portfolio of Customs. Whaitiri is to remain as the MP for Ikaroa-Rawhiti.[691][692]

Karel Sroubek
In late October and early November 2018, the Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway drew criticism from the opposition National Party for his decision to grant residency to the convicted Czech drug smuggler Karel Sroubek. It subsequently emerged that Sroubek had a lengthy criminal record in both the Czech Republic and New Zealand. The case also attracted considerable media interest in New Zealand and led the Czech government to announce that it would seek Sroubek's extradition.[693][694] In mid-December 2018, Lees-Galloway attributed his decision to grant Sroubek residency to incomplete information provided by Immigration New Zealand about Sroubek's criminal record.[695]

2019 Labour sexual assault allegations
In early August 2019, several reports emerged about allegations of bullying, sexual harassment, and resignations from the Labour Party. Media were told that the formal complaints did not involve sexual assaults.[696][697] On 9 September, the online media outlet The Spinoff published an exclusive report by a 19-year-old female Labour Party volunteer alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by a Labour Party staffer.[698] In response to the report, Prime Minister Ardern said that she was repeatedly told by Labour that the complaint was not about sexual assault and that a review by Maria Dew QC will clear up the contradictory claims. The woman has stood by her claims while Labour Party President Nigel Haworth defended his handling of the complaints process.[696][697]

On 11 September, Haworth resigned as Labour Party President following criticism of his handling of the complaints about the male staffer from several Labour Party members including bullying, harassment, and sexual assault. Earlier investigations had exonerated the man of these various claims.[699][700] These sexual assault allegations attracted coverage from several international media including the AFP, The Washington Post, Seven News, The Times, and The Sydney Morning Herald.[700][701] That same day, the National Party's deputy leader Paula Bennett claimed under parliamentary privilege that several of the Prime Minister's senior staff members and a Cabinet minister including Ardern's former chief of staff Mike Munro, current chief press secretary Andrew Campbell, and the director of the Labour leader's office Rob Salmond were aware of the sexual allegations.[702]

On 12 September, the male Labour staffer accused of bullying and sexual assault resigned. He stated that he was cooperating with the Dew Inquiry and denied the allegations against him.[703][704] On 16 September, Prime Minister Ardern announced that Labour would be holding a second inquiry into its response to the sexual assault allegations made against the staffer. Simon Mitchell, the lawyer tasked with leading Labour's investigation into the misconduct, stated that he was unaware of the sexual assault allegations until they were first reported by the media. National Party deputy leader Bennett claimed that the proposed inquiry did not go far enough and alleged that Finance Minister Grant Robertson had been aware of the sexual assault allegations as early as June 2019.[705][706]

On 18 December, Labour Party President Claire Szabo released the report by Maria Dew QC. While Dew's report found insufficient evidence to support allegations of sexual assault and harassment, it found that the former Labour Party staffer had shown "overbearing and aggressive" behaviour on five occasions. Dew recommended a letter cautioning the former staffer and that he write a letter of apology and participate in a restorative justice process with the victim.[707][708]

Shane Jones
In November 2019, Infrastructure Minister and NZ First MP Shane Jones claimed Indian arranged marriages to be a sham and not adhering to the New Zealand way of life. His comments, described as racist, went unchallenged from the Labour cabinet ministers. He also claimed that arranged marriage partners' visa rules would not apply anymore following changes to the immigration rules.[709] Following a protest in Auckland, Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway explained that immigration rules on arranged marriages were unchanged and clarified the misinformation provided by Shane Jones. Jones made further inflammatory comments against Indian students in January 2020.[710]

Kris Faafoi
In December 2019, Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi was criticised after offering to speed up an immigration visa application for Opshop singer Jason Kerrison's father. Opposition Leader Simon Bridges claimed that Faafoi's actions if proven constituted a conflict of interest that breached Cabinet rules. Faafoi subsequently apologised to Prime Minister Ardern.[711][712][713][714]

David Clark
In early April 2020, Health Minister David Clark drew widespread criticism when he flouted the level four lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand on two occasions. This included driving two kilometres away from his home in Dunedin to ride a mountain bike trail and later driving his family 20 kilometres to a Dunedin beach for a family outing during the first week of the lockdown. After admitting to the two incidents on separate occasions, Clark offered his resignation as Health Minister to Prime Minister Ardern. Ardern declined to accept his resignation but stripped him of his Associate Finance Ministerial portfolio and demoted him to the bottom of Labour's Cabinet list.[715][716][717][718]

However, Clark subsequently resigned on 2 July,[719] and was replaced in Health by Chris Hipkins[720] while Housing Minister Megan Woods assumed responsibility for Border Management.[721]

List of executive members

First meeting of the Cabinet of the Sixth Labour Government, 26 October 2017
On 20 October, Jacinda Ardern announced that the Cabinet would consist of 20 members, of which 16 would be from the Labour Party and 4 from New Zealand First. A further five Labour MPs would sit outside of Cabinet, along with three Green MPs. On 27 June 2019, a cabinet reshuffle occurred.[134][135]

On 2 November 2020, after the 2020 election, a new cabinet reflective of the Labour majority was announced.[722] It was sworn in on 6 November 2020. On 14 June 2022, a cabinet reshuffle occurred.[723]

Chris Hipkins succeeded Ardern as prime minister on 25 January 2023 and a minor cabinet reshuffle occurred to reallocate Ardern's and Hipkins' previous portfolios, as well as the appointment of Carmel Sepuloni as deputy prime minister.[724] Hipkins announced a wider reshuffle of portfolios the following week, on 31 January.[581][725]
